To gain insights of the molecular underpinning of this process, we generated a single-nuclei multiome atlas of the human developing retina with approximately 300,000 nuclei from 12 donors aged between 10 and 23 weeks post-conception with matched macula and peripheral regions from each donor. This atlas captures all major cell classes and over 50 cell types in the retina along with a large proportion of progenitors and cell-type-specific precursors. Cell trajectory analysis reveals a transition from continuous progression in early progenitor cells to a hierarchical development during the later stages of cell type specification. Both known and novel candidate transcription factors, along with gene regulatory networks that drive the transitions of various cell fates, are identified. Comparisons between macular and peripheral retina indicate a largely consistent yet distinct developmental pattern. In particular, the retinoic acid pathway emerges as a potential key driver for retinal patterning. This multiome developing retina atlas offers unparalleled resolution into the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility landscape during development, presenting an invaluable resource for deeper

To gain insights of the molecular underpinning of this process, we generated a single-nuclei multiome atlas of the human developing retina with approximately 300,000 nuclei from 12 donors aged between 10 and 23 weeks post-conception with matched macula and peripheral regions from each donor. This atlas captures all major cell classes and over 50 cell types in the retina along with a large proportion of progenitors and cell-type-specific precursors. Cell trajectory analysis reveals a transition from continuous progression in early progenitor cells to a hierarchical development during the later stages of cell type specification. Both known and novel candidate transcription factors, along with gene regulatory networks that drive the transitions of various cell fates, are identified. Comparisons between macular and peripheral retina indicate a largely consistent yet distinct developmental pattern.

To gain insights of the molecular underpinning of this process, we generated a single-nuclei multiome atlas of the human developing retina with approximately 300,000 nuclei from 12 donors aged between 10 and 23 weeks post-conception with matched macula and peripheral regions from each donor. This atlas captures all major cell classes and over 50 cell types in the retina along with a large proportion of progenitors and cell-type-specific precursors. Cell trajectory analysis reveals a transition from continuous progression in early progenitor cells to a hierarchical development during the later stages of cell type specification. Both known and novel candidate transcription factors, along with gene regulatory networks that drive the transitions of various cell fates, are identified. Comparisons between macular and peripheral retina indicate a largely consistent yet distinct developmental pattern. In particular, the retinoic acid pathway emerges as a potential key driver for retinal patterning.

To gain insights of the molecular underpinning of this process, we generated a single-nuclei multiome atlas of the human developing retina with approximately 300,000 nuclei from 12 donors aged between 10 and 23 weeks post-conception with matched macula and peripheral regions from each donor. This atlas captures all major cell classes and over 50 cell types in the retina along with a large proportion of progenitors and cell-type-specific precursors. Cell trajectory analysis reveals a transition from continuous progression in early progenitor cells to a hierarchical development during the later stages of cell type specification. Both known and novel candidate transcription factors, along with gene regulatory networks that drive the transitions of various cell fates, are identified. Comparisons between macular and peripheral retina indicate a largely consistent yet distinct developmental pattern. In particular, the retinoic acid pathway emerges as a potential key driver for retinal patterning. This multiome developing retina atlas offers unparalleled resolution into the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility landscape during development, presenting an invaluable resource for deeper

To gain insights of the molecular underpinning of this process, we generated a single-nuclei multiome atlas of the human developing retina with approximately 300,000 nuclei from 12 donors aged between 10 and 23 weeks post-conception with matched macula and peripheral regions from each donor. This atlas captures all major cell classes and over 50 cell types in the retina along with a large proportion of progenitors and cell-type-specific precursors. Cell trajectory analysis reveals a transition from continuous progression in early progenitor cells to a hierarchical development during the later stages of cell type specification. Both known and novel candidate transcription factors, along with gene regulatory networks that drive the transitions of various cell fates, are identified. Comparisons between macular and peripheral retina indicate a largely consistent yet distinct developmental pattern. In particular, the retinoic acid pathway emerges as a potential key driver for retinal patterning. This multiome developing retina atlas offers unparalleled resolution into the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility landscape during development, presenting an invaluable resource for deeper
