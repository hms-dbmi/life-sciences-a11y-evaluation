It is thus important to explore the concordance between the expression in various cell lines vis-à-vis human native and disease tissues. In this study, we investigate the expression of all human protein-coding genes in more than 1,000 human cell lines representing 27 cancer types by a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis. The cell line gene expression is compared with the corresponding profiles in various tissues, organs, single-cell types and cancers. Here, we present the expression for each cell line and give guidance for the most appropriate cell line for a given experimental study. In addition, we explore the cancer-related pathway and cytokine activity of the cell lines to aid human biology studies and drug development projects. All data are presented in an open access cell line section of the Human Protein Atlas to facilitate the exploration of all human protein-coding genes across these cell lines.\n           (2024-01-02 10:30:22 UTC)\" href=\"/publications/687\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">","target":["a[href=\"/publications/687\"][data-original-title=\"\"][title=\"\"]:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"color-contrast","data":{"fgColor":"#337ab7","bgColor":"#ffffff","contrastRatio":4.55,"fontSize":"10.5pt (14px)","fontWeight":"normal","expectedContrastRatio":"4.5:1"},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"serious","message":"Element has sufficient color contrast of 4.55"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a data-tooltip=\"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a key component of the insulin signaling pathway that controls cellular me-tabolism and growth. Loss-of-function mutations in PI3K signaling and other downstream effectors of the insulin signaling pathway extend the lifespan of various model organisms. However, the pro-longevity effect appears to be sex-specific and young mice with reduced PI3K signaling have increased risk of cardiac disease. Hence, it remains elusive as to whether PI3K inhibition is a valid strategy to delay aging and extend healthspan in humans. We recently demonstrated that reduced PI3K activity in cardiomyocytes delays cardiac growth, causing subnormal contractility and cardiopulmonary functional capacity, as well as increased risk of mortality at young age. In stark contrast, in aged mice, experi-mental attenuation of PI3K signaling reduced the age-dependent decline in cardiac function and extended maximal lifespan, suggesting a biphasic effect of PI3K on cardiac health and survival. The cardiac anti-aging effects of reduced PI3K activity coincided with enhanced oxida-tive phosphorylation and required increased autophagic flux. In humans, explanted failing hearts showed in-creased PI3K signaling, as indicated by increased phos-phorylation of the serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT. Hence, late-life cardiac-specific targeting of PI3K might have a therapeutic potential in cardiac aging and related diseases.

The network converging on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) kinase constitutes a central hub that integrates metabolic signals and adapts cellular metabolism and functions to nutritional changes and stress. Feedforward and feedback loops, crosstalks and a plethora of modulators finely balance MTOR-driven anabolic and catabolic processes. This complexity renders it difficult - if not impossible - to intuitively decipher signaling dynamics and network topology. Over the last two decades, systems approaches have emerged as powerful tools to simulate signaling network dynamics and responses. In this review, we discuss the contribution of systems studies to the discovery of novel edges and modulators in the MTOR network in healthy cells and in disease.

The assay can measure the levels of various types of damage, including DNA strand breaks, abasic sites and alkali-sensitive sites. Furthermore, the assay can also be modified to include purified DNA glycosylases so that alkylated and oxidized bases can be detected. The CometChip is a higher throughput version of the traditional comet assay and has been used to study cultured cells. Here, we have tested its utility for studies of DNA damage present in vivo. We show that the CometChip is effective in detecting DNA damage in multiple tissues of mice exposed to the direct-acting methylating agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and to the metabolically activated methylating agent N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which has been found to contaminate food, water, and drugs. Specifically, results from MMS-exposed mice demonstrate that DNA damage can be detected in cells from liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, brain and spleen. Results with NDMA show that DNA damage is detectable in metabolically competent tissues (liver, lung, and kidney), and that DNA repair in vivo can be monitored over time. Additionally, it was found that DNA damage persists for many days after exposure. Furthermore, glycosylases were successfully incorporated into the assay to reveal the presence of damaged bases. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the in vivo CometChip and reveals new insights into the formation and repair of DNA damage caused by MMS and NDMA.

It is thus important to explore the concordance between the expression in various cell lines vis-à-vis human native and disease tissues. In this study, we investigate the expression of all human protein-coding genes in more than 1,000 human cell lines representing 27 cancer types by a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis. The cell line gene expression is compared with the corresponding profiles in various tissues, organs, single-cell types and cancers. Here, we present the expression for each cell line and give guidance for the most appropriate cell line for a given experimental study. In addition, we explore the cancer-related pathway and cytokine activity of the cell lines to aid human biology studies and drug development projects. All data are presented in an open access cell line section of the Human Protein Atlas to facilitate the exploration of all human protein-coding genes across these cell lines.\n           (2024-01-02 10:30:22 UTC)\" href=\"/publications/687\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">","target":["a[href=\"/publications/687\"][data-original-title=\"\"][title=\"\"]:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"has-visible-text","data":null,"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"serious","message":"Element has text that is visible to screen readers"}],"all":[],"none":[{"id":"focusable-no-name","data":null,"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"serious","message":"Element is not in tab order or has accessible text"}],"impact":null,"html":"<a data-tooltip=\"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a key component of the insulin signaling pathway that controls cellular me-tabolism and growth. Loss-of-function mutations in PI3K signaling and other downstream effectors of the insulin signaling pathway extend the lifespan of various model organisms. However, the pro-longevity effect appears to be sex-specific and young mice with reduced PI3K signaling have increased risk of cardiac disease. Hence, it remains elusive as to whether PI3K inhibition is a valid strategy to delay aging and extend healthspan in humans. We recently demonstrated that reduced PI3K activity in cardiomyocytes delays cardiac growth, causing subnormal contractility and cardiopulmonary functional capacity, as well as increased risk of mortality at young age. In stark contrast, in aged mice, experi-mental attenuation of PI3K signaling reduced the age-dependent decline in cardiac function and extended maximal lifespan, suggesting a biphasic effect of PI3K on cardiac health and survival. The cardiac anti-aging effects of reduced PI3K activity coincided with enhanced oxida-tive phosphorylation and required increased autophagic flux. In humans, explanted failing hearts showed in-creased PI3K signaling, as indicated by increased phos-phorylation of the serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT. Hence, late-life cardiac-specific targeting of PI3K might have a therapeutic potential in cardiac aging and related diseases.

The network converging on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) kinase constitutes a central hub that integrates metabolic signals and adapts cellular metabolism and functions to nutritional changes and stress. Feedforward and feedback loops, crosstalks and a plethora of modulators finely balance MTOR-driven anabolic and catabolic processes. This complexity renders it difficult - if not impossible - to intuitively decipher signaling dynamics and network topology. Over the last two decades, systems approaches have emerged as powerful tools to simulate signaling network dynamics and responses. In this review, we discuss the contribution of systems studies to the discovery of novel edges and modulators in the MTOR network in healthy cells and in disease.

The assay can measure the levels of various types of damage, including DNA strand breaks, abasic sites and alkali-sensitive sites. Furthermore, the assay can also be modified to include purified DNA glycosylases so that alkylated and oxidized bases can be detected. The CometChip is a higher throughput version of the traditional comet assay and has been used to study cultured cells. Here, we have tested its utility for studies of DNA damage present in vivo. We show that the CometChip is effective in detecting DNA damage in multiple tissues of mice exposed to the direct-acting methylating agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and to the metabolically activated methylating agent N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which has been found to contaminate food, water, and drugs. Specifically, results from MMS-exposed mice demonstrate that DNA damage can be detected in cells from liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, brain and spleen. Results with NDMA show that DNA damage is detectable in metabolically competent tissues (liver, lung, and kidney), and that DNA repair in vivo can be monitored over time. Additionally, it was found that DNA damage persists for many days after exposure. Furthermore, glycosylases were successfully incorporated into the assay to reveal the presence of damaged bases. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the in vivo CometChip and reveals new insights into the formation and repair of DNA damage caused by MMS and NDMA.

It is thus important to explore the concordance between the expression in various cell lines vis-à-vis human native and disease tissues. In this study, we investigate the expression of all human protein-coding genes in more than 1,000 human cell lines representing 27 cancer types by a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis. The cell line gene expression is compared with the corresponding profiles in various tissues, organs, single-cell types and cancers. Here, we present the expression for each cell line and give guidance for the most appropriate cell line for a given experimental study. In addition, we explore the cancer-related pathway and cytokine activity of the cell lines to aid human biology studies and drug development projects. All data are presented in an open access cell line section of the Human Protein Atlas to facilitate the exploration of all human protein-coding genes across these cell lines.\n           (2024-01-02 10:30:22 UTC)\" href=\"/publications/687\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\">","target":["a[href=\"/publications/687\"][data-original-title=\"\"][title=\"\"]:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<br>","target":["#recently_added > .feed > li:nth-child(1) > br"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"subtle\">Publication - added 8 days ago</span>","target":["#recently_added > .feed > li:nth-child(1) > .subtle"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<li>","target":["#recently_added > .feed > li:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"file-type-icon\" data-tooltip=\"Publication\" href=\"/publications/686\" data-original-title=\"\" title=\"\"><img class=\"home_asset_icon\" src=\"/assets/avatars/avatar-publication-2b3a351ab8b28cb9a7c06c893c869371629a1d64af51e17f2d5acb918f409ac8.png\"></a>","target":[".file-type-icon[href=\"/publications/686\"][data-tooltip=\"Publication\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<img class=\"home_asset_icon\" src=\"/assets/avatars/avatar-publication-2b3a351ab8b28cb9a7c06c893c869371629a1d64af51e17f2d5acb918f409ac8.png\">","target":[".file-type-icon[href=\"/publications/686\"][data-tooltip=\"Publication\"] > .home_asset_icon"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a data-tooltip=\"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a key component of the insulin signaling pathway that controls cellular me-tabolism and growth. Loss-of-function mutations in PI3K signaling and other downstream effectors of the insulin signaling pathway extend the lifespan of various model organisms. However, the pro-longevity effect appears to be sex-specific and young mice with reduced PI3K signaling have increased risk of cardiac disease. Hence, it remains elusive as to whether PI3K inhibition is a valid strategy to delay aging and extend healthspan in humans. We recently demonstrated that reduced PI3K activity in cardiomyocytes delays cardiac growth, causing subnormal contractility and cardiopulmonary functional capacity, as well as increased risk of mortality at young age. In stark contrast, in aged mice, experi-mental attenuation of PI3K signaling reduced the age-dependent decline in cardiac function and extended maximal lifespan, suggesting a biphasic effect of PI3K on cardiac health and survival. The cardiac anti-aging effects of reduced PI3K activity coincided with enhanced oxida-tive phosphorylation and required increased autophagic flux. In humans, explanted failing hearts showed in-creased PI3K signaling, as indicated by increased phos-phorylation of the serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT. Hence, late-life cardiac-specific targeting of PI3K might have a therapeutic potential in cardiac aging and related diseases.

The network converging on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) kinase constitutes a central hub that integrates metabolic signals and adapts cellular metabolism and functions to nutritional changes and stress. Feedforward and feedback loops, crosstalks and a plethora of modulators finely balance MTOR-driven anabolic and catabolic processes. This complexity renders it difficult - if not impossible - to intuitively decipher signaling dynamics and network topology. Over the last two decades, systems approaches have emerged as powerful tools to simulate signaling network dynamics and responses. In this review, we discuss the contribution of systems studies to the discovery of novel edges and modulators in the MTOR network in healthy cells and in disease.

The assay can measure the levels of various types of damage, including DNA strand breaks, abasic sites and alkali-sensitive sites. Furthermore, the assay can also be modified to include purified DNA glycosylases so that alkylated and oxidized bases can be detected. The CometChip is a higher throughput version of the traditional comet assay and has been used to study cultured cells. Here, we have tested its utility for studies of DNA damage present in vivo. We show that the CometChip is effective in detecting DNA damage in multiple tissues of mice exposed to the direct-acting methylating agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and to the metabolically activated methylating agent N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), which has been found to contaminate food, water, and drugs. Specifically, results from MMS-exposed mice demonstrate that DNA damage can be detected in cells from liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, brain and spleen. Results with NDMA show that DNA damage is detectable in metabolically competent tissues (liver, lung, and kidney), and that DNA repair in vivo can be monitored over time. Additionally, it was found that DNA damage persists for many days after exposure. Furthermore, glycosylases were successfully incorporated into the assay to reveal the presence of damaged bases. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the in vivo CometChip and reveals new insights into the formation and repair of DNA damage caused by MMS and NDMA.
