Notably, the MEP pathway is present in bacteria and not in mammals, which makes the enzymes of the MEP pathway attractive targets for discovering new anti-infective agents due to the reduced chances of off-target interactions leading to side effects. There are seven enzymes in the MEP pathway, the third of which is IspD. Two crystal structures of Burkholderia thailandensis IspD (BtIspD) were determined: an apo structure and that of a complex with cytidine triphosphate (CTP). Comparison of the CTP-bound BtIspD structure with the apo structure revealed that CTP binding stabilizes the loop composed of residues 13–19. The apo structure of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis IspD (MpIspD) is also reported. The melting temperatures of MpIspD and BtIspD were evaluated by circular dichroism. The moderate Tm values suggest that a thermal shift assay may be feasible for future inhibitor screening. Finally, the binding affinity of CTP for BtIspD was evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. These structural and biophysical data will aid in the discovery of IspD inhibitors. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X24000645\"> <i>Crystal structure of the RNA-recognition motif of <span class=\"it\"><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></span> tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase homolog A.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X24000645\"> <i>Crystal structure of the RNA-recognition motif of <span class=\"it\"><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></span> tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase homolog A.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Crystal structure of the RNA-recognition motif of <span class=\"it\"><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></span> tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase homolog A.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Witzenberger, M.\">M.

The corresponding human polyQ pathologies include Huntington's disease and constitute a family of devastating neurodegenerative diseases. A polyQ tract in the corresponding disease-linked protein causes neuronal death and symptoms such as impaired motor function, as well as cognitive impairment. In polyQ disease models, silencing of TRMT2A reduced polyQ-associated cell death and polyQ protein aggregation, suggesting this protein as a valid drug target against this class of disorders.

However, much remains to be learned about how conformational changes may convey information through the structure of PTP1B to enable allosteric regulation by ligands or functional responses to mutations. High-resolution X-ray crystallography can offer unique windows into protein conformational ensembles, but comparison of even high-resolution structures is often complicated by differences between data sets, including non-isomorphism. Here, the highest resolution crystal structure of apo wild-type (WT) PTP1B to date is presented out of a total of ∼350 PTP1B structures in the PDB. This structure is in a crystal form that is rare for PTP1B, with two unique copies of the protein that exhibit distinct patterns of conformational heterogeneity, allowing a controlled comparison of local disorder across the two chains within the same asymmetric unit. The conformational differences between these chains are interrogated in the apo structure and between several recently reported high-resolution ligand-bound structures. Electron-density maps in a high-resolution structure of a recently reported activating double mutant are also examined, and unmodeled alternate conformations in the mutant structure are discovered that coincide with regions of enhanced conformational heterogeneity in the new WT structure. These results validate the notion that these mutations operate by enhancing local dynamics, and suggest a latent susceptibility to such changes in the WT enzyme. Together, these new data and analysis provide a detailed view of the conformational ensemble of PTP1B and highlight the utility of high-resolution crystallography for elucidating conformational heterogeneity with potential relevance for function. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23010671\"> <i>Biochemical and structural characterization of a class A β-lactamase from <span class=\"it\"><i>Nocardia cyriacigeorgica</i></span>.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23010671\"> <i>Biochemical and structural characterization of a class A β-lactamase from <span class=\"it\"><i>Nocardia cyriacigeorgica</i></span>.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Biochemical and structural characterization of a class A β-lactamase from <span class=\"it\"><i>Nocardia cyriacigeorgica</i></span>.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Nocardia cyriacigeorgica</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Nocardia cyriacigeorgica</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Feuillard, J.\">J.

Some Nocardia species can infect humans and are usually considered to be opportunist pathogens, as they often infect immunocompromised patients. Although their clinical incidence is low, many Nocardia species are now considered to be emerging pathogens. Primary sites of infection by Nocardia are the skin or the lungs, but dissemination to other body parts is very frequent. These disseminated infections are very difficult to treat and thus are tackled with multiple classes of antibiotics, in addition to the traditional treatment targeting the folate pathway. β-Lactams are often included in the regimen, but many Nocardia species present moderate or strong resistance to some members of this drug class. Genomic, microbiological and biochemical studies have reported the presence of class A β-lactamases (ABLs) in a handful of Nocardia species, but no structural investigation of Nocardia β-lactamases has yet been performed. In this study, the expression, purification and preliminary biochemical characterization of an ABL from an N. cyriacigeorgica (NCY-1) clinical strain are reported. The crystallization and the very high resolution crystal structure of NCY-1 are also described. The sequence and structural analysis of the protein demonstrate that NCY-1 belongs to the class A1 β-lactamases and show its very high conservation with ABLs from other human-pathogenic Nocardia. In addition, the presence of one molecule of citrate tightly bound in the catalytic site of the enzyme is described. This structure may provide a solid basis for future drug development to specifically target Nocardia spp. β-lactamases. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23010579\"> <i>Structure of the outer membrane porin OmpW from the pervasive pathogen <span class=\"it\"><i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i></span>.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23010579\"> <i>Structure of the outer membrane porin OmpW from the pervasive pathogen <span class=\"it\"><i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i></span>.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Structure of the outer membrane porin OmpW from the pervasive pathogen <span class=\"it\"><i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i></span>.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Seddon, C.\">C.

The enzyme occurs as a dimer, which has an indirect effect on the enzyme activity as the monomer retains only ∼35% of the activity. Here, the crystal structure of SOD_CL at 1.86 A resolution is reported that may explain this peculiarity. The&nbsp;crystal belonged to space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 61.11, b&nbsp;=&nbsp;74.55, c = 61.69 A, β = 106.86degrees, and contained four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The overall structure of SOD_CL resembles that of CuZnSOD from plants. The structure of SOD_CL shows a unique arrangement of surface loop IV that connects the dimer interface and the active site, which is located away from the dimer-interface region. This arrangement allows direct interaction between the residues residing in the dimer interface and those in the active site. The arrangement also includes Leu62 and Gln164, which are conserved in cytoplasmic CuZnSOD. This supports the classification of SOD_CL as a cytoplasmic CuZnSOD despite sharing the highest amino-acid sequence homology with CuZnSODs from spinach and tomato, which are chloroplastic. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23009536\"> <i>The crystal structure of the human smacovirus 1 Rep domain.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23009536\"> <i>The crystal structure of the human smacovirus 1 Rep domain.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>The crystal structure of the human smacovirus 1 Rep domain.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Lim%26%23243;n, L.K.\">L.

TCSs respond to environmental signals and change gene-expression levels. The HK QseE and the RR QseF regulate the virulence of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. The operon encoding QseE/QseF also contains a gene encoding an outer membrane lipoprotein, qseG. The protein product QseG interacts with QseE in the periplasmic space to control the activity of QseE and constitutes a unique QseE/F/G three-component system. However, the structural bases of their functions are unknown. Here, crystal structures of the periplasmic regions of QseE and QseG were determined with the help of AlphaFold models. The periplasmic region of QseE has a helix-bundle structure as found in some HKs. The QseG structure is composed of an N-terminal globular domain and a long C-terminal helix forming a coiled-coil-like structure that contributes to dimerization. Comparison of QseG structures obtained from several crystallization conditions shows that QseG has structural polymorphisms at the C-terminus of the coiled-coil structure, indicating that the C-terminus is flexible. The C-terminal flexibility is derived from conserved hydrophilic residues that reduce the hydrophobic interaction at the coiled-coil interface. Electrostatic surface analysis suggests that the C-terminal coiled-coil region can interact with QseE. The observed structural fluctuation of the C-terminus of QseG is probably important for interaction with QseE. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23009020\"> <i>Crystal structure of adenylosuccinate lyase from the thermophilic bacterium <span class=\"it\"><i>Thermus thermophilus</i></span> HB8.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23009020\"> <i>Crystal structure of adenylosuccinate lyase from the thermophilic bacterium <span class=\"it\"><i>Thermus thermophilus</i></span> HB8.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Crystal structure of adenylosuccinate lyase from the thermophilic bacterium <span class=\"it\"><i>Thermus thermophilus</i></span> HB8.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Thermus thermophilus</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Thermus thermophilus</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Nemoto, N.\">N.

The ability to recognize two different sets of substrates is of structural and evolutionary interest. In the present study, the crystal structure of PurB from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TtPurB) was determined at a resolution of 2.38 A by molecular replacement using a structure predicted by AlphaFold2 as a template. The asymmetric unit of the TtPurB crystal contained two TtPurB molecules, and some regions were disordered in the crystal structure. The disordered regions were the substrate-binding site and domain 3. TtPurB forms a homotetramer and the monomer is composed of three domains (domains 1, 2 and 3), which is a typical structure for the aspartase/fumarase superfamily. Molecular dynamics simulations with and without substrate/product were performed using a full-length model of TtPurB which was obtained before deletion of the disordered regions. The substrates and products were bound to the model structures during the MD simulations. The fluctuations of amino-acid residues were greater in the disordered regions and became smaller upon the binding of substrate or product. These results demonstrate that the full-length model obtained using AlphaFold2 can be used to generate the coordinates of disordered regions within the crystal structure. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X2300883X\"> <i>Using structural genomics depositions in undergraduate teaching of protein crystallography: everybody wins.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X2300883X\"> <i>Using structural genomics depositions in undergraduate teaching of protein crystallography: everybody wins.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Using structural genomics depositions in undergraduate teaching of protein crystallography: everybody wins.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\"><a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Agirre, J.\">J.

In this paper, some guidelines and instructions on depositing raw data to Zenodo are given. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23007288\"> <i>Biochemical and X-ray analyses of the players involved in the <span class=\"it\"><i>faRel</i></span>2/<span class=\"it\"><i>aTfaRel</i></span>2 toxin–antitoxin operon.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053230X23007288\"> <i>Biochemical and X-ray analyses of the players involved in the <span class=\"it\"><i>faRel</i></span>2/<span class=\"it\"><i>aTfaRel</i></span>2 toxin–antitoxin operon.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Biochemical and X-ray analyses of the players involved in the <span class=\"it\"><i>faRel</i></span>2/<span class=\"it\"><i>aTfaRel</i></span>2 toxin–antitoxin operon.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>faRel</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(1)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>faRel</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(1) > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>aTfaRel</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>aTfaRel</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(2) > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Dominguez-Molina, L.\">L.

D7 encodes a bicistronic type II toxin–antitoxin (TA) module. The FaRel2 toxin is a toxic small alarmone synthetase (toxSAS) that inhibits translation through the pyrophosphorylation of uncharged tRNAs at the 3′-CCA end. The toxin is neutralized by the antitoxin ATfaRel2 through the formation of an inactive TA complex. Here, the production, biophysical analysis and crystallization of ATfaRel2 and FaRel2 as well as of the ATfaRel2–FaRel2 complex are reported. ATfaRel2 is monomeric in solution. The antitoxin crystallized in space group P21212 with unit-cell parameters a = 53.3, b = 34.2, c = 37.6 A, and the best crystal diffracted to a resolution of 1.24 A. Crystals of FaRel2 in complex with APCPP, a nonhydrolysable ATP analogue, belonged to space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 31.5, b = 60.6, c = 177.2 A, β = 90.6degrees, and diffracted to 2.6 A resolution. The ATfaRel2–FaRel2Y128F complex forms a heterotetramer in solution composed of two toxins and two antitoxins. This complex crystallized in two space groups: F4132, with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 227.1 A, and P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 51.7, b = 106.2, c = 135.1 A. The crystals diffracted to 1.98 and 2.1 A resolution, respectively. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_share >
