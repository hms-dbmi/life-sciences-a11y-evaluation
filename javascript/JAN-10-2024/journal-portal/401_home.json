The effect of density modification on the starting maps from either source is illustrated in the case of SHELXE. The different modes in which the program can run are reviewed; these include less well known uses such as reading external phase values and weights or phase distributions encoded in Hendrickson–Lattman coefficients. Typically in SHELXE, initial phases are calculated from experimental data, from a partial model or map, or from a combination of both sources. The initial phase set is improved and extended by density modification and, if the resolution of the data and the type of structure permits, polyalanine tracing. As a feature to systematically eliminate model bias from phases derived from predicted models, the trace can be set to exclude the area occupied by the starting model. The trace now includes an extension into the gamma position or hydrophobic and aromatic side chains if a sequence is provided, which is performed in every tracing cycle. Once a correlation coefficient of over 30% between the structure factors calculated from such a trace and the native data indicates that the structure has been solved, the sequence is docked in all model-building cycles and side chains are fitted if the map supports it. The extensions to the tracing algorithm brought in to provide a complete model are discussed. The improvement in phasing performance is assessed using a set of tests. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323010483\"> <i>The TR-<span class=\"it\"><i>ic</i></span>OS setup at the ESRF: time-resolved microsecond UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy on protein crystals.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323010483\"> <i>The TR-<span class=\"it\"><i>ic</i></span>OS setup at the ESRF: time-resolved microsecond UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy on protein crystals.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>The TR-<span class=\"it\"><i>ic</i></span>OS setup at the ESRF: time-resolved microsecond UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy on protein crystals.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>ic</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>ic</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Engilberge, S.\">S.

Using pump–probe schemes, this should make the mechanistic study of photoactive proteins and other suitable systems possible with time resolutions down to microseconds. In order to identify relevant time delays, time-resolved spectroscopic experiments directly performed on protein crystals are often desirable. To this end, an instrument has been built at the icOS Lab (in crystallo Optical Spectroscopy Laboratory) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility using reflective focusing objectives with a tuneable nanosecond laser as a pump and a microsecond xenon flash lamp as a probe, called the TR-icOS (time-resolved icOS) setup. Using this instrument, pump–probe spectra can rapidly be recorded from single crystals with time delays ranging from a few microseconds to seconds and beyond. This can be repeated at various laser pulse energies to track the potential presence of artefacts arising from two-photon absorption, which amounts to a power titration of a photoreaction. This approach has been applied to monitor the rise and decay of the M state in the photocycle of crystallized bacteriorhodopsin and showed that the photocycle is increasingly altered with laser pulses of peak fluence greater than 100 mJ cm−2, providing experimental laser and delay parameters for a successful TR-MX experiment. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323010586\"> <i>Deep residual networks for crystallography trained on synthetic data.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323010586\"> <i>Deep residual networks for crystallography trained on synthetic data.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Deep residual networks for crystallography trained on synthetic data.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Mendez, D.\">D.

To address this, a codebase called Resonet was developed for synthesizing diffraction data and training residual neural networks on these data. Here, two per-pattern capabilities of Resonet are demonstrated: (i) interpretation of crystal resolution and (ii) identification of overlapping lattices. Resonet was tested across a compilation of diffraction images from synchrotron experiments and X-ray free-electron laser experiments. Crucially, these models readily execute on graphics processing units and can thus significantly outperform conventional algorithms. While Resonet is currently utilized to provide real-time feedback for macromolecular crystallography users at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, its simple Python-based interface makes it easy to embed in other processing frameworks. This work highlights the utility of physics-based simulation for training deep neural networks and lays the groundwork for the development of additional models to enhance diffraction collection and analysis. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323010562\"> <i>Preparation and characterization of inactivated tick-borne encephalitis virus samples for single-particle imaging at the European XFEL.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323010562\"> <i>Preparation and characterization of inactivated tick-borne encephalitis virus samples for single-particle imaging at the European XFEL.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Preparation and characterization of inactivated tick-borne encephalitis virus samples for single-particle imaging at the European XFEL.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Vorovitch, M.F.\">M.

To achieve this ambitious goal with today's technologies, about 1 ml of purified virus suspension containing at least 1012 particles per millilitre is required. Such large amounts of concentrated suspension have never before been obtained for enveloped viruses. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) represents an attractive model system for the development of enveloped virus purification and concentration protocols, given the availability of large amounts of inactivated virus material provided by vaccine-manufacturing facilities. Here, the development of a TBEV vaccine purification and concentration scheme is presented combined with a quality-control protocol that allows substantial amounts of highly concentrated non-aggregated suspension to be obtained. Preliminary single-particle imaging experiments were performed for this sample at the European XFEL, showing distinct diffraction patterns. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323009609\"> <i>Structural mechanism of <span class=\"it\"><i>Escherichia coli</i></span> cyanase.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323009609\"> <i>Structural mechanism of <span class=\"it\"><i>Escherichia coli</i></span> cyanase.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Structural mechanism of <span class=\"it\"><i>Escherichia coli</i></span> cyanase.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Escherichia coli</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Escherichia coli</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Kim, J.\">J.

The structures of cyanase complexed with dianion inhibitors, in conjunction with biochemical studies, suggest putative binding sites for substrates. However, the substrate-recognition and reaction mechanisms of cyanase remain unclear. Here, crystal structures of cyanase from Escherichia coli were determined in the native form and in complexes with cyanate, bicarbonate and intermediates at 1.5–1.9 A resolution using synchrotron X-rays and an X-ray free-electron laser. Cyanate and bicarbonate interact with the highly conserved Arg96, Ser122 and Ala123 in the active site. In the presence of a mixture of cyanate and bicarbonate, three different electron densities for intermediates were observed in the cyanase structures. Moreover, the observed electron density could explain the dynamics of the substrate or product. In addition to conformational changes in the substrate-binding pocket, dynamic movement of Leu151 was observed, which functions as a gate for the passage of substrates or products. These findings provide a structural mechanism for the substrate-binding and reaction process of cyanase. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323009142\"> <i>Using graphlet degree vectors to predict atomic displacement parameters in protein structures.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323009142\"> <i>Using graphlet degree vectors to predict atomic displacement parameters in protein structures.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Using graphlet degree vectors to predict atomic displacement parameters in protein structures.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\"><a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Pra%26%23382;nikar, J.\">J.

Their distribution over the structure can provide hints on local structural reliability and mobility. A spatial macromolecular model can be represented by a graph whose nodes are atoms and whose edges correspond to all interatomic contacts within a certain distance. Small connected subgraphs, called graphlets, provide information about the wiring of a particular atom. The multiple linear regression approach based on this information aims to predict a distribution of values of isotropic atomic displacement parameters (B values) within a protein structure, given the atomic coordinates and molecular packing. By modeling the dynamic component of atomic uncertainties, this method allows the B values obtained from experimental crystallographic or cryo-electron microscopy studies to be reproduced relatively well. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008914\"> <i>Improved joint X-ray and neutron refinement procedure in <span class=\"it\"><i>Phenix</i></span>.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008914\"> <i>Improved joint X-ray and neutron refinement procedure in <span class=\"it\"><i>Phenix</i></span>.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Improved joint X-ray and neutron refinement procedure in <span class=\"it\"><i>Phenix</i></span>.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Phenix</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Phenix</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Liebschner, D.\">D.

However, because of technical limitations and experimental obstacles, the quality of neutron diffraction data is typically much poorer (completeness, resolution and signal to noise) than that of X-ray diffraction data for the same sample. Further, refinement is more complex as it usually requires additional parameters to describe the H (and D) atoms. The increase in the number of parameters may be mitigated by using the `riding hydrogen' refinement strategy, in which the positions of H atoms without a rotational degree of freedom are inferred from their neighboring heavy atoms. However, this does not address the issues related to poor data quality. Therefore, neutron structure determination often relies on the presence of an X-ray data set for joint X-ray and neutron (XN) refinement. In this approach, the X-ray data serve to compensate for the deficiencies of the neutron diffraction data by refining one model simultaneously against the X-ray and neutron data sets. To be applicable, it is assumed that both data sets are highly isomorphous, and preferably collected from the same crystals and at the same temperature. However, the approach has a number of limitations that are discussed in this work by comparing four separately re-refined neutron models. To address the limitations, a new method for joint XN refinement is introduced that optimizes two different models against the different data sets. This approach is tested using neutron models and data deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The efficacy of refining models with H atoms as riding or as individual atoms is also investigated. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008793\"> <i>Neutron crystallographic refinement with <span class=\"it\"><i>REFMAC</i></span>5 from the <span class=\"it\"><i>CCP</i></span>4 suite.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008793\"> <i>Neutron crystallographic refinement with <span class=\"it\"><i>REFMAC</i></span>5 from the <span class=\"it\"><i>CCP</i></span>4 suite.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Neutron crystallographic refinement with <span class=\"it\"><i>REFMAC</i></span>5 from the <span class=\"it\"><i>CCP</i></span>4 suite.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>REFMAC</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(1)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>REFMAC</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(1) > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>CCP</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>CCP</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(2) > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Catapano, L.\">L.

However, their direct visualization by diffraction techniques is challenging. Macromolecular X-ray crystallography affords the localization of only the most ordered H atoms at (sub-)atomic resolution (around 1.2 A or higher). However, many H atoms of biochemical significance remain undetectable by this method. In contrast, neutron diffraction methods enable the visualization of most H atoms, typically in the form of deuterium (2H) atoms, at much more common resolution values (better than 2.5 A). Thus, neutron crystallography, although technically demanding, is often the method of choice when direct information on protonation states is sought. REFMAC5 from the Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4) is a program for the refinement of macromolecular models against X-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM data. This contribution describes its extension to include the refinement of structural models obtained from neutron crystallographic data. Stereochemical restraints with accurate bond distances between H atoms and their parent atom nuclei are now part of the CCP4 Monomer Library, the source of prior chemical information used in the refinement. One new feature for neutron data analysis in REFMAC5 is refinement of the protium/deuterium (1H/2H) fraction. This parameter describes the relative 1H/2H contribution to neutron scattering for hydrogen&nbsp;isotopes. The newly developed REFMAC5 algorithms were tested by performing the (re-)refinement of several entries available in the PDB and of one novel structure (FutA) using either (i) neutron data only or (ii) neutron data supplemented by external restraints to a reference X-ray crystallographic structure. Re-refinement with REFMAC5 afforded models characterized by R-factor values that are consistent with, and in some cases better than, the originally deposited values. The use of external reference structure restraints during refinement has been observed to be a valuable strategy, especially for structures at medium–low resolution. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008847\"> <i>The bad and the good of trends in model building and refinement for sparse-data regions: pernicious forms of overfitting versus good new tools and predictions.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008847\"> <i>The bad and the good of trends in model building and refinement for sparse-data regions: pernicious forms of overfitting versus good new tools and predictions.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>The bad and the good of trends in model building and refinement for sparse-data regions: pernicious forms of overfitting versus good new tools and predictions.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Richardson, J.S.\">J.

However, at local resolutions worse than 2.5 A both the procedures and their validation break down and do not ensure reliably correct models. This is because in the broad density at lower resolution, critical features such as protein backbone carbonyl O atoms are not just less accurate but are not seen at all, and so peptide orientations are frequently wrongly fitted by 90–180degrees. This puts both backbone and side chains into the wrong local energy minimum, and they are then worsened rather than improved by further refinement into a valid but incorrect rotamer or Ramachandran region. On the positive side, new tools are being developed to locate this type of pernicious error in PDB depositions, such as CaBLAM, EMRinger, Pperp diagnosis of ribose puckers, and peptide flips in PDB-REDO, while interactive modeling in Coot or ISOLDE can help to fix many of them. Another positive trend is that artificial intelligence predictions such as those made by AlphaFold2 contribute additional evidence from large multiple sequence alignments, and in high-confidence parts they provide quite good starting models for loops, termini or whole domains with otherwise ambiguous density. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S205979832300880X\"> <i>Anaerobic fixed-target serial crystallography using sandwiched silicon nitride membranes.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S205979832300880X\"> <i>Anaerobic fixed-target serial crystallography using sandwiched silicon nitride membranes.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Anaerobic fixed-target serial crystallography using sandwiched silicon nitride membranes.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Bjel%26%23269;i%26%23263;, M.\">M.

Various fixed-target serial crystallography techniques have been developed, ranging from commercially available chips to in-house designs implemented at different synchrotron facilities. Nevertheless, there is currently no commercially available chip (known to the authors) specifically designed for the direct handling of oxygen-sensitive samples. This study presents a methodology employing silicon nitride chips arranged in a `sandwich' configuration, enabling reliable room-temperature data collection from oxygen-sensitive samples. The method involves the utilization of a custom-made 3D-printed assembling tool and a MX sample holder. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin samples were investigated using the BioMAX X-ray macromolecular crystallography beamline, the Balder X-ray absorption spectroscopy beamline and UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008732\"> <i>Structural and functional characterization of the novel endo-α(1,4)-fucoidanase Mef1 from the marine bacterium <span class=\"it\"><i>Muricauda eckloniae</i></span>.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008732\"> <i>Structural and functional characterization of the novel endo-α(1,4)-fucoidanase Mef1 from the marine bacterium <span class=\"it\"><i>Muricauda eckloniae</i></span>.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Structural and functional characterization of the novel endo-α(1,4)-fucoidanase Mef1 from the marine bacterium <span class=\"it\"><i>Muricauda eckloniae</i></span>.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Muricauda eckloniae</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Muricauda eckloniae</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Mikkelsen, M.D.\">M.

Fucoidans are a compositionally and structurally diverse class of fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharides that are primarily found in brown seaweeds. Here, the structural characterization of a novel endo-α(1,4)-fucoidanase, Mef1, from the marine bacterium Muricauda eckloniae is presented, showing sequence similarity to members of glycoside hydrolase family 107. Using carbohydrate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, it is shown that the fucoidanase Mef1 catalyzes the&nbsp;cleavage of α(1,4)-linkages between fucose residues sulfated on C2 in the structure [-3)-α-L-Fucp2S-(1,4)-α-L-Fucp2S-(1-]n in fucoidan from Fucus evanescens. Kinetic analysis of Mef1 activity by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the specific Mef1 fucoidanase activity (Uf) on F.&nbsp;evanescens fucoidan was 0.1 x 10−3 Uf microM−1. By crystal structure determination of Mef1 at 1.8 A resolution, a single-domain organization comprising a (β/α)8-barrel domain was determined. The active site was in an extended, positively charged groove that is likely to be designed to accommodate the binding of the negatively charged, sulfated fucoidan substrate. The active site of Mef1 comprises the amino acids His270 and Asp187, providing acid/base and nucleophile groups, respectively, for the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in the fucoidan backbone. Electron densities were identified for two possible Ca2+ ions in the enzyme, one of which is partially exposed to the active-site groove, while the other is very tightly coordinated. A water wire was discovered leading from the exterior of the Mef1 enzyme into the active site, passing the tightly coordinated Ca2+ site. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008501\"> <i>Cocrystallization of ubiquitin–deubiquitinase complexes through disulfide linkage.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323008501\"> <i>Cocrystallization of ubiquitin–deubiquitinase complexes through disulfide linkage.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Cocrystallization of ubiquitin–deubiquitinase complexes through disulfide linkage.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\"><a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Negron Teron, K.I.\">K.

The Ub electrophiles are accessed through intein chemistry in conjunction with chemical synthesis. Here, it was asked whether DUB–Ub covalent complexes could instead be accessed by simpler disulfide chemistry using a Ub cysteine mutant in which the last glycine has been replaced with a cysteine. The Ub cysteine mutant displayed a wide variability in disulfide formation across a panel of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DUBs, with some showing no detectable reaction while others robustly produced a disulfide complex. Using this approach, two disulfide-linked ubiquitin-bound complexes were crystallized, one involving the Legionella pneumophila effector SdeA DUB and the other involving the Orientia effector OtDUB. These DUBs had previously been crystallized in Ub-bound forms using the C-terminal electrophile strategy and noncovalent complexation, respectively. While the disulfide-linked SdeA DUB–Ub complex crystallized as expected, in the OtDUB complex the disulfide bond to the Ub mutant involved a cysteine that differed from the catalytic cysteine. Disulfide formation with the SdeA DUB catalytic cysteine was accompanied by local distortion of the helix carrying the active-site cysteine, whereas OtDUB reacted with the Ub mutant using a surface-exposed cysteine. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323006642\"> <i>Atypical homodimerization revealed by the structure of the (<span class=\"it\"><i>S</i></span>)-enantioselective haloalkane dehalogenase DmmarA from <span class=\"it\"><i>Mycobacterium marinum</i></span>.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Atypical homodimerization revealed by the structure of the (<span class=\"it\"><i>S</i></span>)-enantioselective haloalkane dehalogenase DmmarA from <span class=\"it\"><i>Mycobacterium marinum</i></span>.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>S</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(1)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>S</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(1) > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Mycobacterium marinum</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it:nth-child(2) > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Snajdarova, K.\">K.

Atomic-level knowledge of both the inner organization and supramolecular complexation of HLDs is thus crucial to understand their catalytic and noncatalytic functions. Here, crystallographic structures of the (S)-enantioselective haloalkane dehalogenase DmmarA from the waterborne pathogenic microbe Mycobacterium marinum were determined at 1.6 and 1.85 A resolution. The structures show a canonical αβα-sandwich HLD fold with several unusual structural features. Mechanistically, the atypical composition of the proton-relay catalytic triad (aspartate–histidine–aspartate) and uncommon active-site pocket reveal the molecular specificities of a catalytic apparatus that exhibits a rare (S)-enantiopreference. Additionally, the structures reveal a previously unobserved mode of symmetric homodimerization, which is predominantly mediated through unusual L5-to-L5 loop interactions. This homodimeric association in solution is confirmed experimentally by data obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering. Utilizing the newly determined structures of DmmarA, molecular modelling techniques were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanism behind its uncommon enantioselectivity. The (S)-preference can be attributed to the presence of a distinct binding pocket and variance in the activation barrier for nucleophilic substitution. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323007507\"> <i>Domain structure and cross-linking in a giant adhesin from the <span class=\"it\"><i>Mobiluncus mulieris</i></span> bacterium.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323007507\"> <i>Domain structure and cross-linking in a giant adhesin from the <span class=\"it\"><i>Mobiluncus mulieris</i></span> bacterium.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Domain structure and cross-linking in a giant adhesin from the <span class=\"it\"><i>Mobiluncus mulieris</i></span> bacterium.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>Mobiluncus mulieris</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Mobiluncus mulieris</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Young, P.G.\">P.

While investigating the prevalence of such cross-links, a remarkable example was discovered in Mobiluncus mulieris, a pathogen associated with bacterial vaginosis. This organism encodes a putative adhesin of 7651 residues. Crystallography and mass spectrometry of two selected domains, and AlphaFold structure prediction of the remainder of the protein, were used to show that this adhesin belongs to the family of thioester, isopeptide and ester-bond-containing proteins (TIE proteins). It has an N-terminal domain homologous to thioester adhesion domains, followed by&nbsp;51 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains containing ester- or isopeptide-bond cross-links. The energetic cost to the M. mulieris bacterium in retaining such a large adhesin as a single gene or protein construct suggests a critical role in pathogenicity and/or persistence. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323007611\"> <i>Crystal structures of the DE<span class=\"it\"><i>x</i></span>H-box RNA helicase DHX9.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798323007611\"> <i>Crystal structures of the DE<span class=\"it\"><i>x</i></span>H-box RNA helicase DHX9.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Crystal structures of the DE<span class=\"it\"><i>x</i></span>H-box RNA helicase DHX9.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"it\"><i>x</i></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>x</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i > .it > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Lee, Y.-T.\">Y.-T.

DHX9 has recently emerged as a promising target for oncology, but to date no mammalian structures have been published. Here, crystal structures of human, dog and cat DHX9 bound to ADP are reported. The three mammalian DHX9 structures share identical structural folds. Additionally, the overall architecture and the individual domain structures of DHX9 are highly conserved with those of MLE, the Drosophila orthologue of DHX9 previously solved in complex with RNA and a transition-state analogue of ATP. Due to differences in the bound substrates and global domain orientations, the localized loop conformations and occupancy of dsRNA-binding domain 2 (dsRBD2) differ between the mammalian DHX9 and MLE structures. The combined effects of the structural changes considerably alter the RNA-binding channel, providing an opportunity to compare active and inactive states of the helicase. Finally, the mammalian DHX9 structures provide a potential tool for structure-based drug-design efforts. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_share >
