It is also possible, but not yet demonstrated, that some individuals with obesity with relatively low leptin levels for their degree of obesity might respond to exogenous leptin with weight loss.

Following initiating TP53 mutation, fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells proliferate and form secretory cell expansion with a TP53 signature. Follicular fluid released during ovulation contains ROS, which induces inflammation and can cause additional mutations and increased genetic instability. Mutated pathways include DNA repair processes, antiapoptotic pathways, and growth pathways.

This process results in expression of the adult isoforms of the chloride and calcium channels, which, together with SERCA1 and RyR1, facilitate proper muscle contraction and relaxation. In DM1, MBNL sequestration on expanded CUG repeats causes the dysregulation of CLCN1 and CACNA1S alternative splicing. The inclusion of a CLCN1 fetal exon leads to a frameshift and premature stop codon, causing ClC-1 loss. Mis-splicing also leads to expression of the Cav1.1 fetal isoform, which has an increased calcium current compared with the adult isoform.

(D) Cell viability of doxycycline-inducible (Dox-inducible) MCF7 cells and parental cells with or without 10 nM E2 growing in hormone-depleted medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL Dox; plotted as mean ± SD (n = 6), with P values calculated from Welch’s t test for mutant versus parental cells on the final day indicated. (E) Plot of the percentage increase in confluence from initial time point for the Dox-inducible MCF7 cells, growing in hormone-depleted medium with 0.5 μg/mL of Dox. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM (n = 6); statistical analysis was performed using 2-way ANOVA for mutant versus WT on the final day indicated. (F) MCF7 HA-ESR1 WT or mutant–expressing cell-derived xenograft tumor growth represented as mean ± SEM (n = 3–6 mice per group). The estrogen pellet was removed after the tumor volume reached 250 mm3, and mice were fed with Dox to induce HA-tagged ESR1 expression. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way ANOVA on the final day indicated. F461V had 2 mice after day 16 and hence was not included in statistical analysis. (G and H) Growth inhibition of MCF7 cells expressing HA-ESR1 mutants or empty vector, as measured by cell viability assay, in the presence of fulvestrant (G) and elacestrant (H); EC50 values for sigmoidal fit are presented in Supplemental Tables 2 and 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.\">","target":["#panel9 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row >

and adiposity. Circulating leptin levels fall with starvation and rise to prior levels with refeeding. It is possible, but not yet demonstrated, that some lean individuals respond briskly to rising leptin to prevent obesity or respond to another as-yet undiscovered signal to prevent obesity. It is also possible, but not yet demonstrated, that some individuals with obesity with relatively low leptin levels for their degree of obesity might respond to exogenous leptin with weight loss. Most individuals with obesity have high leptin levels to which they are partially resistant, causing them to be unresponsive to exogenous leptin. This “leptin resistance” may be caused by desensitization induced by hyperleptinemia.\">","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(1) > .small-12.columns > .row > .medium-3.hide-for-small.columns > a[ref=\"group\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<img src=\"//dm5migu4zj3pb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/174000/174595/small/JCI174595.f1.gif\">","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(1) > .small-12.columns > .row > .medium-3.hide-for-small.columns > a[ref=\"group\"] > img"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<hr>","target":["#panel3 > hr"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"row\">","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(3)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"small-12 columns\">","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"small-12  columns\">","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row > .small-12.columns"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"small-12 columns\">\n<h5 class=\"article-title\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><a href=\"/articles/view/176856\">Solid organ transplantation: solid but not yet spectacular</a></h5>\n</div>\n</div>","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row > .small-12.columns > .row:nth-child(1)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"small-12 columns\">\n<h5 class=\"article-title\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><a href=\"/articles/view/176856\">Solid organ transplantation: solid but not yet spectacular</a></h5>\n</div>","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row > .small-12.columns > .row:nth-child(1) > .small-12.columns"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<h5 class=\"article-title\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><a href=\"/articles/view/176856\">Solid organ transplantation: solid but not yet spectacular</a></h5>","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row > .small-12.columns > .row:nth-child(1) > .small-12.columns > .article-title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"/articles/view/176856\">Solid organ transplantation: solid but not yet spectacular</a>","target":[".article-title > a[href=\"/articles/view/176856\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"row\">","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row > .small-12.columns > .row:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"small-12 columns article-metadata\">","target":["#panel3 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row > .small-12.columns > .row:nth-child(2) > .article-metadata.small-12.columns"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"hide-for-small show-more\" data-reveal-id=\"article44648-more\" href=\"#\">\n<div class=\"article-authors\">\nLaurence A.

Following initiating TP53 mutation, fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells proliferate and form secretory cell expansion with a TP53 signature. Follicular fluid released during ovulation contains ROS, which induces inflammation and can cause additional mutations and increased genetic instability. Mutated pathways include DNA repair processes, antiapoptotic pathways, and growth pathways. The secretory cells become irregular in size and shape, and the tissue becomes disordered as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma lesions develop. Finally, transformed cells begin to dissociate from the precursor lesion leading to metastasis.

Traditional small-molecule inhibitors often act by blocking the catalytic function of the targeted protein of interest (POI). POIs that lack ligandable enzymatic sites have historically posed a challenge for drug discovery, earning such proteins the label of “undruggable.” Induced protein degradation, in which a small molecule facilitates the degradation of a POI, has emerged as a powerful strategy to target undruggable proteins. Degrader molecules not only expand the druggable proteome, but also enable elimination of all functions of the degraded protein, both enzymatic and scaffolding.

cause myotonia and muscle weakness in DM1. In unaffected muscle tissues, MBNL correctly regulates splicing of the alternative exons in CLCN1 and CACNA1S. This process results in expression of the adult isoforms of the chloride and calcium channels, which, together with SERCA1 and RyR1, facilitate proper muscle contraction and relaxation. In DM1, MBNL sequestration on expanded CUG repeats causes the dysregulation of CLCN1 and CACNA1S alternative splicing. The inclusion of a CLCN1 fetal exon leads to a frameshift and premature stop codon, causing ClC-1 loss. Mis-splicing also leads to expression of the Cav1.1 fetal isoform, which has an increased calcium current compared with the adult isoform. The combined loss of ClC-1 and expression of the fetal Cav1.1 isoform leads to severe myopathy that can be rescued pharmacologically by blocking the calcium channel using verapamil.\">","target":["#panel7 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row > .medium-3.hide-for-small.columns >

(A) ESR1 mutations (n = 649) in breast cancer samples from the MSK clinical sequencing cohort. NTD, N-terminal domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; LBD, ligand-binding domain; CTD, C-terminal domain. (B) Mapping of a few of the ESR1 mutations onto the structure of the ERα-LBD (Protein Data Bank ID 1GWR). Residues in the vicinity of the dimer interface are shown in red (a red arrow indicates the disordered region having residue S463), and those closer to the H11–H12 loop are shown in blue. (C) Luciferase reporter assay of MCF7 cells transfected with the HA-tagged ESR1 mutants/WT or empty vector (EV), estrogen response element (ERE)–luciferase reporter, and Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids. The graph represents individual data points and mean ± SD (n = 3), with P values (Welch’s t test) for mutant versus WT indicated. (D) Cell viability of doxycycline-inducible (Dox-inducible) MCF7 cells and parental cells with or without 10 nM E2 growing in hormone-depleted medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL Dox; plotted as mean ± SD (n = 6), with P values calculated from Welch’s t test for mutant versus parental cells on the final day indicated. (E) Plot of the percentage increase in confluence from initial time point for the Dox-inducible MCF7 cells, growing in hormone-depleted medium with 0.5 μg/mL of Dox. Data are plotted as mean ± SEM (n = 6); statistical analysis was performed using 2-way ANOVA for mutant versus WT on the final day indicated. (F) MCF7 HA-ESR1 WT or mutant–expressing cell-derived xenograft tumor growth represented as mean ± SEM (n = 3–6 mice per group). The estrogen pellet was removed after the tumor volume reached 250 mm3, and mice were fed with Dox to induce HA-tagged ESR1 expression. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-way ANOVA on the final day indicated. F461V had 2 mice after day 16 and hence was not included in statistical analysis. (G and H) Growth inhibition of MCF7 cells expressing HA-ESR1 mutants or empty vector, as measured by cell viability assay, in the presence of fulvestrant (G) and elacestrant (H); EC50 values for sigmoidal fit are presented in Supplemental Tables 2 and 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.\">","target":["#panel9 > .row:nth-child(3) > .small-12.columns > .row >
