The latter information is contained within diffuse scattering but is challenging to exploit, particularly in single-crystal systems. Separation of the diffuse scattering into its constituent components can greatly simplify analysis and allows for quantitative parameters describing the disorder to be extracted directly. Here, a deep-learning method, DSFU-Net, is presented based on the Pix2Pix generative adversarial network, which takes a plane of diffuse scattering as input and factorizes it into the contributions from the molecular form factor and the chemical short-range order. DSFU-Net was trained on 198 421 samples of simulated diffuse scattering data and performed extremely well on the unseen simulated validation dataset in this work. On a real experimental example, DSFU-Net successfully reproduced the two components with a quality sufficient to distinguish between similar structural models based on the form factor and to refine short-range-order parameters, achieving values comparable to other established methods. This new approach could streamline the analysis of diffuse scattering as it requires minimal prior knowledge of the system, allows access to both components in seconds and is able to compensate for small regions with missing data. DSFU-Net is freely available for use and represents a first step towards an automated workflow for the analysis of single-crystal diffuse scattering. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(1) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(1) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S205225252301000X\"> <i>Orientational ordering and assembly of silica–nickel Janus particles in a magnetic field.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S205225252301000X\"> <i>Orientational ordering and assembly of silica–nickel Janus particles in a magnetic field.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Orientational ordering and assembly of silica–nickel Janus particles in a magnetic field.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Manna, G.\">G.

Even in a weak applied field, the net magnetic moments of the individual particles aligned in the direction of the field, as indicated by the anisotropy in the recorded USAXS patterns. X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) measurements on these suspensions revealed that the corresponding particle dynamics are primarily Brownian diffusion [Zinn, Sharpnack &amp; Narayanan (2023). Soft Matter, 19, 2311–2318]. At higher fields, the magnetic forces led to chain-like configurations of particles, as indicated by an additional feature in the USAXS pattern. A theoretical framework is provided for the quantitative interpretation of the observed anisotropic scattering diagrams and the corresponding degree of orientation. No anisotropy was detected when the magnetic field was applied along the beam direction, which is also replicated by the model. The method presented here could be useful for the interpretation of oriented scattering patterns from a wide variety of particulate systems. The combination of USAXS and XPCS is a powerful approach for investigating asymmetric colloidal particles in external fields. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523009582\"> <i>The role of alkyl chain length in the melt and solution crystallization of paliperidone aliphatic prodrugs.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523009582\"> <i>The role of alkyl chain length in the melt and solution crystallization of paliperidone aliphatic prodrugs.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>The role of alkyl chain length in the melt and solution crystallization of paliperidone aliphatic prodrugs.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Chen, A.\">A.

However, to our knowledge, the crystallization behavior of prodrugs modified with different fatty acids has not been explored. In the present work, a series of paliperidone aliphatic prodrugs with alkyl chain lengths ranging from C4 to C16 was investigated with respect to crystal structure, crystal morphology and crystallization kinetics. The paliperidone derivatives exhibited isostructural crystal packing, despite the different alkyl chain lengths, and crystallized with the dominant (100) face in both melt and solution. The rate of crystallization for paliperidone derivatives in the melt increases with alkyl chain length owing to greater molecular mobility. In contrast, the longer chains prolong the nucleation induction time and reduce the crystal growth kinetics in solution. The results show a correlation between difficulty of nucleation in solution and the interfacial energy. This work provides insight into the crystallization behavior of paliperidone aliphatic prodrugs and reveals that the role of alkyl chain length in the crystallization behavior has a strong dependence on the crystallization method. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010436\"> <i>What is isostructurality?

Questions on the definition\" addthis:description=\" Investigation of isostructurality leads to a deeper understanding of close-packing principles and contributes to the ability of crystal engineering. A given packing motif may tolerate small molecular changes within a limit. Slight alterations of a crystal packing arrangement are carried out in order to fine-tune the structural and macroscopic properties, keeping the balance of the spatial requirements and electrostatic effects of the altered molecules in the crystals, preserving their isostructurality. Even so, the definition of isostructurality is not explicit about several issues. Are the corresponding structures required to have the same stoichiometry, Z′, symmetry elements and the same space group? Because it is not obvious in the definition, studies on structure analysis and software calculating various numerical descriptors developed for the quantitative comparison of the degree of similarity of isostructural crystals self-define their criteria. The extent of the difference between corresponding crystal structures referred to as isostructural is not limited. Should it be determined numerically? There is nothing in the definition about a demand for similar supramolecular arrangements in isostructural crystals. Should the similarity of supramolecular interactions be a criterion of isostructurality? The definition of isostructurality deserves reconsideration regarding symmetry, measure of similarity and formation of supramolecular interactions. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(4) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523009995\"> <i>Conformation–aggregation interplay in the simplest aliphatic ethers probed under high pressure.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523009995\"> <i>Conformation–aggregation interplay in the simplest aliphatic ethers probed under high pressure.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Conformation–aggregation interplay in the simplest aliphatic ethers probed under high pressure.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(5) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Sacharczuk, N.\">N.

Within crystallography and closely related subject areas, there is already a high level of conformance to the generally accepted FAIR principles (that data be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) through the adoption of common information exchange protocols by databases, publishers, instrument vendors, experimental facilities and software authors. Driven by the success within these domains, the IUCr has worked closely with CODATA (the Committee on Data of the International Science Council) to help develop the latter's commitment to cross-domain integration of discipline-specific data. The IUCr has, in particular, emphasized the need for standards relating to data quality and completeness as an adjunct to the FAIR data landscape. This can ensure definitive reusable data, which in turn can aid interoperability across domains. A microsymposium at the IUCr 2023 Congress provided an up-to-date survey of data interoperability within and outside of crystallography, expounded using a broad range of examples. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010928\"> <i>A new era is emerging at scientific user facilities.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010928\"> <i>A new era is emerging at scientific user facilities.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>A new era is emerging at scientific user facilities.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\"><a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Argyriou, D.\">D.

The snapshot data acquisition in SerialED can be realized using both transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopes (TEM/STEM). However, the current SerialED workflow based on STEM setups requires special external devices and software, which limits broader adoption. Here, we present a simplified experimental implementation of STEM-based SerialED on Thermo Fisher Scientific STEMs using common proprietary software interfaced through Python scripts to automate data collection. Specifically, we utilize TEM Imaging and Analysis (TIA) scripting and TEM scripting to access the STEM functionalities of the microscope, and DigitalMicrograph scripting to control the camera for snapshot data acquisition. Data analysis adapts the existing workflow using the software CrystFEL, which was developed for serial X-ray crystallography. Our workflow for STEM SerialED can be used on any Gatan or Thermo Fisher Scientific camera. We apply this workflow to collect high-resolution STEM SerialED data from two aluminosilicate zeolites, zeolite Y and ZSM-25. We demonstrate, for the first time, ab initio structure determination through direct methods using STEM SerialED data. Zeolite Y is relatively stable under the electron beam, and STEM SerialED data extend to 0.60 A. We show that the structural model obtained using STEM SerialED data merged from 358 crystals is nearly identical to that using continuous rotation electron diffraction data from one crystal. This demonstrates that accurate structures can be obtained from STEM SerialED. Zeolite ZSM-25 is very beam-sensitive and has a complex structure. We show that STEM SerialED greatly improves the data resolution of ZSM-25, compared with serial rotation electron diffraction (SerialRED), from 1.50 to 0.90 A. This allows, for the first time, the use of standard phasing methods, such as direct methods, for the ab initio structure determination of ZSM-25. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010357\"> <i>Orientational analysis of atomic pair correlations in nanocrystalline indium oxide thin films.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010357\"> <i>Orientational analysis of atomic pair correlations in nanocrystalline indium oxide thin films.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Orientational analysis of atomic pair correlations in nanocrystalline indium oxide thin films.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(10) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Hoffman, J.M.\">J.

However, traditional speckle-tracking imaging methods suffer from phase distortion at locations with abrupt changes in density, which is always the case for real samples, limiting the applications of the speckle-tracking X-ray imaging method. In this paper, we report a deep-learning based method which can achieve dynamic X-ray speckle-tracking imaging with high-accuracy phase retrieval. The calibration results of a phantom show that the profile of the retrieved phase is highly consistent with the theoretical one. Experiments of polyurethane foaming demonstrated that the proposed method revealed the evolution of the complicated microstructure of the bubbles accurately. The proposed method is a promising solution for dynamic X-ray imaging with high-accuracy phase retrieval, and has extensive applications in metrology and quantitative analysis of dynamics in material science, physics, chemistry and biomedicine. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(11) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010254\"> <i>Refining short-range order parameters from the three-dimensional diffuse scattering in single-crystal electron diffraction data.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010254\"> <i>Refining short-range order parameters from the three-dimensional diffuse scattering in single-crystal electron diffraction data.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Refining short-range order parameters from the three-dimensional diffuse scattering in single-crystal electron diffraction data.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Poppe, R.\">R.

Nb0.84CoSb was chosen as a reference material. The correlations between neighbouring vacancies and the displacements of Sb and Co atoms were refined from the diffuse scattering using a Monte Carlo refinement in DISCUS. The difference between the Sb and Co displacements refined from the diffuse scattering and the Sb and Co displacements refined from the Bragg reflections in single-crystal X-ray diffraction data is 0.012 (7) A for the refinement on diffuse scattering in single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and 0.03 (2) A for the refinement on the diffuse scattering in single-crystal electron diffraction data.

However, as the sample's orientation in each diffraction pattern is unknown, advanced algorithms are required to reconstruct the 3D diffraction intensity volume and subsequently the sample's density model. While most approaches perform 3D reconstruction via determining the orientation of each diffraction pattern, a correlation-based approach utilizes the averaged spatial correlations of diffraction intensities over all patterns, making it well suited for processing experimental data with a poor signal-to-noise ratio of individual patterns. Here, a method is proposed to determine the 3D structure of a sample by analyzing the double, triple and quadruple spatial correlations in diffraction patterns. This ab initio method can reconstruct the basic shape of an irregular unsymmetric 3D sample without requiring any prior knowledge of the sample. The impact of background and noise on correlations is investigated and corrected to ensure the success of reconstruction under simulated experimental conditions. Additionally, the feasibility of using the correlation-based approach to process incomplete partial diffraction patterns is demonstrated. The proposed method is a variable addition to existing algorithms for 3D reconstruction and will further promote the development and adoption of XFEL single-particle imaging techniques. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010308\"> <i>C-SPAM: an open-source time-resolved specimen vitrification device with light-activated molecules.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523010308\"> <i>C-SPAM: an open-source time-resolved specimen vitrification device with light-activated molecules.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>C-SPAM: an open-source time-resolved specimen vitrification device with light-activated molecules.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Monta%26%23241;o Romero, A.\">A.

When data quality permits, this method can be extended to hydrogen-bonded transition metals (TMs), as in hydride complexes. However, addressing hydrogen thermal motions with HAR, particularly in TM hydrides, presents a challenge. At the same time, proper description of thermal vibrations can be vital for determining hydrogen positions correctly. In this study, we employ tools such as SHADE3 and Normal Mode Refinement (NoMoRe) to estimate anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) for hydrogen atoms during HAR and IAM refinements performed for seven structures of TM (Fe, Ni, Cr, Nb, Rh and Os) and metalloid (Sb) hydride complexes for which both the neutron and the X-ray structures have been determined. A direct comparison between neutron and HAR/SHADE3/NoMoRe ADPs reveals that the similarity between neutron hydrogen ADPs and those estimated with NoMoRe or SHADE3 is significantly higher than when hydrogen ADPs are refined with HAR. Regarding TM—H bond lengths, traditional HAR exhibits a slight advantage over the other methods. However, combining NoMoRe/SHADE3 with HAR results in a minor decrease in agreement with neutron TM—H bond lengths. For the Cr complex, for which high-resolution X-ray data were collected, an investigation of resolution-related effects was possible. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523009247\"> <i>A new polymorph of white phospho­rus at ambient conditions.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523009247\"> <i>A new polymorph of white phospho­rus at ambient conditions.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>A new polymorph of white phospho­rus at ambient conditions.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Herbst-Irmer, R.\">R.

For industrial and academic applications, white phosphorus is the most important. So far, three polymorphs of white phosphorus, all consisting of P4 tetrahedra, have been described. Among these, β-P4 crystallizes in the space group P1 and γ-P4 in the space group C2/m. α-P4 forms soft plastic crystals with a proposed structure in the cubic space group I43m with the lattice constant a = 18.51 (3) A, consisting of 58 rotationally disordered tetrahedra and thus is similar to the structure of α-Mn. Here we present a new polymorph, δ-P4. It crystallizes as a sixfold twin with the cell dimensions a = 18.302 (2), b = 18.302 (2), c = 36.441 (3) A in the space group P212121 with 29 P4 tetrahedra in the asymmetric unit. The arrangement resembles the structure of α-Mn, but δ-P4 differs from α-P4. DFT calculations show δ-P4 to be metastable at a similar energy level to that of γ-P4. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(16) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div id=\"side\">","target":["#side"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div id=\"whyus\">","target":["#whyus"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<h3>Why choose <span class=\"jnl\"><span class=\"iucrjname\">IUCrJ</span></span>?</h3>","target":["#whyus > h3"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"jnl\"><span class=\"iucrjname\">IUCrJ</span></span>","target":[".jnl"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"iucrjname\">IUCrJ</span>","target":[".jnl > .iucrjname"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<ul>\n    <li>High profile, high impact</li>\n    <li>Fast publication, excellent technical editing</li>\n    <li>Unlimited readership, fully open access</li>\n        </ul>","target":["#whyus > ul"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<li>High profile, high impact</li>","target":["#whyus > ul > li:nth-child(1)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<li>Fast publication, excellent technical editing</li>","target":["#whyus > ul > li:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<li>Unlimited readership, fully open access</li>","target":["#whyus > ul > li:nth-child(3)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"side_box\">","target":[".side_box:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div id=\"sideeditors\">","target":["#sideeditors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<h3>Editorial Advisory Board</h3>","target":["#sed_narrow > h3"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"ed_name\"><a href=\"http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/detailed_display?id=2657\">T.
