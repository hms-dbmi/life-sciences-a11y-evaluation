At the protein level, this corresponds to H. sapiens EZH2 p.R684C.

therapy reduces hypoxic foci and reorganizes the tumor vasculature. Mice bearing 10-day established orthotopic pancreatic tumors were treated with TH-302 for 5 consecutive days and received 2 doses of αVEGFR-2 administered once every 4 days. On day 15 after tumor challenge, mice were injected with pimonidazole or dextran, and tumors were harvested for optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding. (A) Percentage area per high-power field (hpf) of pimonidazole staining in MT4-LA tumors and representative images (n = 4–6 per group, 4–12 hpf per tumor). (B) [18F]FAZA retention in tumors versus heart (T/H) (n = 12 per group).

(A) Schematic of the workflow for the monotypic and coculture cell models. Representative immunofluorescence images are shown, with green representing the GFP-expressing melanoma cells and red the LECs labeled with anti-CD31. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Figure generated by BioRender.com. (B) Spheroid-sprouting assay of LECs cultured as a monotypic control culture (LEC) or as a melanoma cell coculture (LEC* followed by name of the utilized melanoma cell line) for 2 days before cell separation by FACS. Representative images of spheroids after 4 days in fibrin are shown. Quantification of sprouting area from 3 independent experiments of at least 3 spheroids per condition is shown in the right panel. (C) Tube formation assay of LECs and LECs* cultured and sorted as in A and seeded on Cultrex for 16 hours. Representative images from 3 independent experiments are shown on the left panel and quantification of branch length on the right panel. (D) Monotypic control LECs and LECs* originating from a coculture with WM852 melanoma cell line were analyzed by an electrical cell impedance assay after 2 days of culture. A representative assay of 2 independent experiments is shown. Thicker lines indicate mean values and thinner lines ±SD. (E) Immunofluorescence images of the indicated proteins of monotypic LECs or LECs* originating from a coculture with the WM852 melanoma cell line. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Representative images from 3 independent experiments are shown. Scale bar: 50 μm. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001 by 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test (B, C, and E) or AUC analysis followed by unpaired, 2-tailed t test

overgrowth in female mice. (A) Four base changes were introduced into exon 18 of M. musculus Ezh2, changing codon CGA (Arg 679) in the catalytic SET domain (yellow) to TGT (Cys) and introducing 2 silent mutations to create an Nsp1 restriction site for genotyping. At the protein level, this corresponds to H. sapiens EZH2 p.R684C. (B) Chromatogram traces for E14.5 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are WT at the Ezh2 locus (+/+), heterozygous (R684C/+), or homozygous for the R684C variant allele (R684C/R684C). (C) Western blot detecting EZH2 and ACTB in whole-cell lysates from Ezh2+/+, Ezh2R684C/+, and Ezh2R684C/R684C MEFs, as well as H3K27me3 and H3 in corresponding histone-extracted samples. H3 and ACTB served as loading controls. (D) Quantification of the Western blot shows that EZH2 protein levels do not differ between genotypes, after normalization to ACTB loading control. One-way ANOVA. (E) Relative to Ezh2+/+, the ratio of H3K27me3 to H3 is reduced to a mean of 0.65 in Ezh2R684C/+ and 0.23 in Ezh2R684C/R684C. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test. For D and E, blue circles represent Ezh2+/+; red triangles represent Ezh2R684C/+; purple squares represent Ezh2R684C/R684C. n = 4 in each group. (F) Female Ezh2R684C/+ mice have increased body weight at 8 weeks of age compared with female Ezh2+/+ littermates. Ezh2+/+ males, n = 14; Ezh2+/+ females, n = 9. Ezh2R684C/+ males, n = 8; Ezh2R684C/+ females, n = 10. Blue circles represent Ezh2+/+; red triangles represent Ezh2R684C/+. ***P < 0.001, unpaired Student’s t test.
