It is shown that avoidance of Si–O–Si bridges may account for avoidance of Al–O–Al bridges. In view of this interpretation, it is proposed that the most favourable distributions of cations entering in substitution of silicon in the framework are associated to maximal independent sets of the respective 3-periodic nets. Among all possible solutions, only those with maximal symmetry are realized. The applicability of the concept is demonstrated for a few natural tectosilicates, which have been analysed through the prism of their labelled quotient graph. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(1) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(1) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact[href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323009300\"> <i>Deep learning applications in protein crystallography.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323009300\"> <i>Deep learning applications in protein crystallography.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Deep learning applications in protein crystallography.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Matinyan, S.\">S.

In recent years, researchers have started to explore the potential of deep learning in the field of structural biology, including protein crystallography. This field has some significant challenges, in particular producing high-quality and well ordered protein crystals. Additionally, collecting diffraction data with high completeness and quality, and determining and refining protein structures can be problematic. Protein crystallographic data are often high-dimensional, noisy and incomplete. Deep learning algorithms can extract relevant features from these data and learn to recognize patterns, which can improve the success rate of crystallization and the quality of crystal structures. This paper reviews progress in this field. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(2) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact[href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323010550\"> <i>Analytical models representing X-ray form factors of ions.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323010550\"> <i>Analytical models representing X-ray form factors of ions.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Analytical models representing X-ray form factors of ions.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(3) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\"><a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Thorkildsen, G.\">G.

There has been a growing interest in applying spin symmetry analysis with the spin space group in the field of magnetism. However, there is no established algorithm to search for spin symmetry operations of the spin space group. This paper presents an exhaustive algorithm for determining the spin symmetry operations of commensurate spin arrangements. The present algorithm searches for spin symmetry operations from the symmetry operations of a corresponding nonmagnetic crystal structure and determines their spin-rotation parts by solving a Procrustes problem.

Monoclinic phases have been actively invoked to describe the phase boundaries such as the so-called morphotropic phase boundary in functional perovskite oxides. These phases are believed to play a major role in the enhancement of such functional properties as dielectricity and electromechanical coupling through rotation of spontaneous polarization and/or modification of the rich domain microstructures. Unfortunately, such microstructures remain poorly understood due to the complexity of the subject. The goal of this work is to formulate the geometrical laws behind the monoclinic domain microstructures. Specifically, the result of previous work [Gorfman et al. (2022). Acta Cryst. A78, 158–171] is implemented to catalog and outline some properties of permissible domain walls that connect `strain' domains with monoclinic (MA/MB type) symmetry, occurring in ferroelectric perovskite oxides. The term `permissible' [Fousek &amp; Janovec (1969). J. Appl. Phys. 40, 135–142] pertains to the domain walls connecting a pair of `strain' domains without a lattice mismatch. It was found that 12 monoclinic domains may form pairs connected along 84 types of permissible domain walls. These contain 48 domain walls with fixed Miller indices (known as W-walls) and 36 domain walls whose Miller indices may change when free lattice parameters change as well (known as S-walls). Simple and intuitive analytical expressions are provided that describe the orientation of these domain walls, the matrices of transformation between crystallographic basis vectors and, most importantly, the separation between Bragg peaks, diffracted from each of the 84 pairs of domains, connected along a permissible domain wall. It is shown that the orientation of a domain wall may be described by the specific combination of the monoclinic distortion parameters r = [2/(γ − α)][(c/a) − 1], f = (π − 2γ)/(π − 2α) and p = [2/(π − α − γ)] [(c/a) − 1]. The results of this work will enhance understanding and facilitate investigation (e.g. using single-crystal X-ray diffraction) of complex monoclinic domain microstructures in both crystals and thin films. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(6) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact[href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323009269\"> <i>Periodic Borromean rings, rods and chains.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323009269\"> <i>Periodic Borromean rings, rods and chains.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Periodic Borromean rings, rods and chains.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(7) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\"><a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=O'Keeffe, M.\">M.

A hierarchical scheme is used where any crystal structure is described as a set of topological representations, each of which corresponds to a particular assignment of bonds encoded by a periodic net. In this set, two limiting nets are distinguished, complete and skeletal, which contain, respectively, all possible bonds and the minimal number of bonds required to keep the structure periodicity. Special attention is paid to the skeletal net since it describes the connectivity of a crystal structure in the simplest way, thus enabling one to find unobvious relations between crystalline substances of different composition and architecture. The tools for the automated hierarchical topological analysis have been implemented in the program package ToposPro. Examples, which illustrate the advantages of such analysis, are considered for a number of classes of crystalline substances: elements, intermetallics, ionic and coordination compounds, and molecular crystals. General provisions of the application of the skeletal net concept are also discussed. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(8) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact[href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323009543\"> <i>Isogonal 2-periodic polycatenanes: chain mail.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323009543\"> <i>Isogonal 2-periodic polycatenanes: chain mail.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Isogonal 2-periodic polycatenanes: chain mail.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(9) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\"><a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=O'Keeffe, M.\">M.

By varying the voltage assignments, one obtains geometrically distinct – and occasionally topologically distinct – Euclidean graphs. The focus here is on deriving simple graphs, i.e. graphs with no loops or lunes, especially uninodal edge transitive graphs. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(12) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact[href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323009385\"> <i>Identification of Kikuchi lines in electron diffraction patterns collected in small-angle geometry.</i> </a></span>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323009385\"> <i>Identification of Kikuchi lines in electron diffraction patterns collected in small-angle geometry.</i> </a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<i>Identification of Kikuchi lines in electron diffraction patterns collected in small-angle geometry.</i>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_title > a[title=\"Open URL link\"] > i"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_authors\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_details > .art_authors"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a href=\"//scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/citedin?search_on=name&amp;author_name=Mitura, Z.\">Z.

The results of such pattern transformations are shown for SrTiO3 with mixed surface termination for data collected at different azimuths of the incident electron beam. A simplified analytical approach for the theoretical description of filtered Kikuchi patterns is proposed and discussed. Some examples of raw and filtered patterns for thin films are shown. RHEED patterns may be treated as a result of coherent and incoherent scattering of electron waves. The effects of coherent scattering may be considered as those occurring due to wave diffraction by an idealized crystal and, usually, only effects of this type are analysed to obtain structural information on samples investigated with the use of RHEED. However, some incoherent scattering effects mostly caused by thermal vibrations of atoms, known as Kikuchi effects, may also be a source of valuable information on the arrangements of atoms near the surface. Typically, for the case of RHEED, Kikuchi features are hidden in the intensity background and researchers cannot easily recognize them. In this paper, it is shown that the visibility of features of this type can be substantially enhanced using computer graphics methods. \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(13) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact[href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323008446\"> <i>Site-occupancy factors in the Debye scattering equation.

Cryst. 43, 1543–1547], it includes contributions from uncorrelated thermal agitation terms and, for defective crystalline nanoparticles (NPs), average site-occupancy factors (s.o.f.'s). The s.o.f.'s were introduced heuristically and no theoretical demonstration was provided. This paper presents in detail such a demonstration, corrects a glitch present in the original MDSE, and discusses the s.o.f.'s physical significance. Three new MDSE expressions are given that refer to distinct defective NP ensembles characterized by: (i) vacant sites with uncorrelated constant site-occupancy probability; (ii) vacant sites with a fixed number of randomly distributed atoms; (iii) self-excluding (disordered) positional sites. For all these cases, beneficial aspects and shortcomings of introducing s.o.f.'s as free refinable parameters are demonstrated. The theoretical analysis is supported by numerical simulations performed by comparing the corrected MDSE profiles and the ones based on atomistic modeling of a large number of NPs, satisfying the structural conditions described in (i)–(iii). \">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<a class=\"addthis_button_compact\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\"></a>","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(14) > .art_share > .addthis_toolbox.addthis_default_style > .addthis_button_compact[href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"article\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15)"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<div class=\"art_details\">","target":["#tlate > .article:nth-child(15) > .art_details"]},{"any":[{"id":"region","data":{"isIframe":false},"relatedNodes":[],"impact":"moderate","message":"All page content is contained by landmarks"}],"all":[],"none":[],"impact":null,"html":"<span class=\"art_title\"><a title=\"Open URL link\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1107/S2053273323008276\"> <i>Chiral spiral cyclic twins.

Its individual members depend solely on a chosen pair of integer parameters, a modulus m and a multiplier μ. By means of their specific parameterization they comprise local features of both periodic and aperiodic crystals. In particular, chiral spiral cyclic twins are composed of discrete variants of continuous curves known as circle involutes, each discrete spiral being generated from an integer inclination sequence. The geometry of circle involutes does not only provide for a constant orthogonal separation distance between adjacent spiral branches but also yields an approximate delineation of the intrinsically periodic twin domains as well as a single aperiodic core domain interconnecting them.
