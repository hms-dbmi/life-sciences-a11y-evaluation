Many of the newly discovered expressed fragments were verified by RNA blot analysis and a novel technique called differential hybridization mapping (DHM). Interestingly, a significant fraction of these novel fragments are expressed antisense to previously annotated introns. The coding potential of these novel expressed regions is supported by their sequence conservation in the mouse genome.

We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits.

It also provides a readily available source of data for fast validation of experimental results and for exploratory analyses. Finally, it is a shared resource that can be used to foster large-scale collaborations in sleep study.
MASS is composed of cohorts themselves comprising subsets. Recordings within subsets is kept as homogeneous as possible, whereas it is more heterogeneous between subsets. To allow inter-study comparisons, researchers validating their results on MASS are encouraged to specify which portion of the database they used in their assessment (e.g., MASS-C1 for the whole cohort 1, MASS-C1/SS1-SS3 for subsets 1, 2 and 3 of cohort 1).",http://www.ceams-carsm.ca/en/MASS,2014.0,Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine,"Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, Montreal Sacred Heart Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada",,,Canada,,Christian O'Reilly,m-charron@crhsc.rtss.qc.ca,1.0,,9.0,42.0,$2a$10$8PbO5sorE7nvXcoJabMroO5I8DDbcjo9gUUNlBD5SbizXPbiaSMjq,1544146462812.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1517152832000.0,2023-03-03 10:14:20,Other,Literature,sleep,Animal,Homo sapiens,,4.66667,2014.0,,2022-12-04 00:01:44,1.0,home,MASS

Because proteins consist of domains that act as modular functional units, we have extended the analysis in ProtCID to the individual domain level. This has greatly increased the number of large protein-protein clusters in ProtCID, enabling the generation of hypotheses on the structures of biological assemblies of many systems.

Two criteria have to be met for entering WallProtDB. First one is related to the identification of proteins. Only proteins identified in plant with available genomic or ESTs data are considered to ensure unambiguous identification. Second criterion is related to the difficulty to obtain clean cell wall fractions. Indeed, since cell walls constitute an open compartment difficult to isolate, numerous proteins predicted to be intracellular and/or having functions inside the cell have been identified in cell wall extracts. Then, except proteins predicted to be plasma membrane proteins, only proteins having a predicted signal peptide and no known intracellular retention signal are included in the database. In addition, WallProtDB contains information about the strategies used to obtain cell wall protein extracts and to identify proteins by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Mass spectrometry data are included when available. All the proteins of WallProtDB are linked to ProtAnnDB, another database, which contains structural and functional bioinformatics annotations of proteins as well as links to other databases (Aramemnon, CAZy, Planet, Phytozome, UniProt).

Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA, Kjer type, MIM#165500) is characterized by moderate to severe loss of visual acuity with insidious onset in early childhood, blue-yellow dyschromatopsia and central scotoma. Mutations in the optic atrophy 1 gene (OPA1; MIM#605290) are responsible for about 60-80% of the cases of DOA. The spectrum of OPA1-related disorders is highly variable. The age of onset varies from birth to over 60 years, and the severity of the visual loss ranges from subclinical loss to severe blindness. Estimated disease prevalence is between 1:10,000 in Denmark due to a founder effect and 1:35,000 worldwide. Extra ocular features, involving the central, peripheral and autonomous nervous systems, complicating the optic neuropathy are reported in about 20% of the patients carrying OPA1 pathogenic variants, leading to conditions described as the ""DOA plus"" or ""DOA+"" syndromes (MIM#125250). A phenotype fully compatible with the Behr syndrome (MIM#210000), associating early onset and severe optic neuropathy with spinocerebellar ataxia and retarded development was also reported. This variety of phenotypes is attributed to differences in the OPA1 mutations effects (haplo-insufficiency or dominant negative effect), as well as to the mode of inheritance, which may be mono- or more rarely bi-allelic.",http://mitodyn.org/home.php?select_db=OPA1,2015.0,Angers University,"Angers, France.",Angers,,France,v2.0,Marc FERRE,marc.ferre@univ-angers.fr,1.0,2015-01-01,8.0,28.0,$2a$10$XqjoENX2yVBGz/gb8ubIBusAfM4teSPxQW9IJbIK5bHVMsVonZmoy,1543975623449.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1435652169000.0,2023-03-03 10:10:56,"DNA, RNA, Protein",Health and medicine,OPA1,Animal,Homo sapiens,,3.5,0.0,,2022-12-04 00:00:30,0.0,home,Mitodyn/OPA1

These studies usually compare the genetic variation between two groups to single out certain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked to a phenotypic variation in one of the groups. However, it is necessary to have a large enough sample size to find statistically significant correlations. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companies offer the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low cost without the need to consult a physician or geneticist. Over 100,000 people have already been genotyped through Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies. However, this data is not public for a variety of reasons and thus cannot be used in research. It seems reasonable to create a central open data repository for such data. Here we present the web platform openSNP, an open database which allows participants of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing to publish their genetic data at no cost along with phenotypic information.

In order to gain insight into the mango cuticle biogenesis and identify putative cuticle-associated genes, we analyzed the transcriptomes of peels from ripe and overripe mango fruit using RNA-Seq.

As metabolite profiling can characterize the metabolomic phenotype of a genetic perturbation in the plant metabolism, it provides clues to the function(s) of genes of interest. We chose 50 Arabidopsis mutants including a set of characterized and uncharacterized mutants, that resemble wild-type plants. We performed metabolite profiling of the plants using gas chromatography?mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To make the dataset available as an efficient public functional genomics tool for hypothesis generation, we developed our MeKO database. It allows evaluation of whether a mutation affects metabolism during normal plant growth and contains images of mutants, data on differences in metabolite accumulation, and interactive analysis tools. Non-processed data, including chromatograms, mass spectra, and experimental metadata, follow the guidelines set by Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) and are freely downloadable. Proof-of-concept analysis suggests that the MeKO database is highly useful for the generation of hypotheses for genes of interest and for improving gene annotation.

To improve the determination of tree shrew CDSs, we performed sequencing of the whole-genome, mRNA, and total RNA and integrated the resulting data. Additionally, we established criteria for the selection of reliable CDSs and annotated these sequences by comparison to the human transcriptome, resulting in the identification of complete CDSs for 12,612 tree shrew genes and yielding a more accurate tree shrew genome database (TupaiaBase: http://tupaiabase.org ).",http://tupaiabase.org,2019.0,Kagoshima University,"Transboundary Animal Diseases Centre, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kagoshima University, 1-21-24, Korimoto, Kagoshima, Kagoshima 890-0065 Japan",,,Japan,,Kyoko Tsukiyama-Kohara,kkohara@vet.kagoshima-u.ac.jp,1.0,,4.0,10.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1572061540000.0,2023-03-03 10:16:39,"DNA, RNA","Gene genome and annotation, Genotype phenotype and variation","transcribed genome, transcript and genomic data",Animal,Tupaia belangeri,,2.5,0.0,,2022-12-04 00:02:32,0.0,home,TupaiaBase

Their records are derived from laboratory work undertaken by different individuals, by different teams, with a range of technologies and assumptions and over a period of decades. As a consequence, they contain a great many duplicates, redundancies and inconsistencies, but neither the prevalence nor the characteristics of various types of duplicates have been rigorously assessed. Existing duplicate detection methods in bioinformatics only address specific duplicate types, with inconsistent assumptions; and the impact of duplicates in bioinformatics databases has not been carefully assessed, making it difficult to judge the value of such methods. Our goal is to assess the scale, kinds and impact of duplicates in bioinformatics databases, through a retrospective analysis of merged groups in INSDC databases. Our outcomes are threefold: (1) We analyse a benchmark dataset consisting of duplicates manually identified in INSDC-a dataset of 67 888 merged groups with 111 823 duplicate pairs across 21 organisms from INSDC databases - in terms of the prevalence, types and impacts of duplicates. (2) We categorize duplicates at both sequence and annotation level, with supporting quantitative statistics, showing that different organisms have different prevalence of distinct kinds of duplicate. (3) We show that the presence of duplicates has practical impact via a simple case study on duplicates, in terms of GC content and melting temperature. We demonstrate that duplicates not only introduce redundancy, but can lead to inconsistent results for certain tasks.

It comprises two main sections. First is the QC Pack wrapper, which executes three QC tools: FastQC, RNA-SeQC, and selected functions from RSeQC. Combining these three tools into one wrapper provides increased ease of use and provides a much more complete view of sample data quality than any individual tool. Second is the QC database, which displays the resulting metrics in a user-friendly web interface. It was designed to allow users with less computational experience to easily generate and view QC information for their data, to investigate individual samples and aggregate reports of sample groups, and to sort and search samples based on quality.

RNA editing was initially described in trypanosomes where it modifies different mRNAs by the deletion and/or insertion of uridines in specific positions. Then, it has been also discovered in various organisms and generally classified in ""insertion/deletion editing"" (which involves the insertion or deletion of specific nucleotides) or ""substitution editing"" (which involves the change of a specific nucleotide).
To date, different RNA editing types have been identified. Although evolutionary unrelated, they occur in the nucleus as well as in organelles of different organisms.To overcome these limitations, we developed REDIdb a specialized database for RNA editing modifications in plant organelles. Hereafter we describe its third release containing more than 26,000 events in a completely novel web interface to accommodate RNA editing in its genomics, biological and evolutionary context through whole genome maps and multiple sequence alignments.

Survival analysis has been applied to TCGA data to find genomic features that are predictive of patient survival. Typically drug exposure data is not considered due to its naming conventions. However, this represents a missed opportunity. We have standardized the drug names in TCGA\'s drug exposure data, and performed survival analysis on drug-stratified subpopulations. By integrating of gene copy number, drug exposure and patient survival data, we inferred gene-drug interactions that impact survival. The collection of all analyzed gene-drug interactions in 32 cancer types are organized and presented here. GDISC allows biologists and clinicians to interactively explore the gene-drug interactions identified in TCGA, and discover interactions associated to their favorite cancer, drug and/or gene. GDISC and the accompanying standardized drug data will be updated with new TCGA releases.

Cork oak forests are of great ecological importance and represent a major economic and social resource in Southern Europe and Northern Africa.

These sequences can be used as reference sequences for high-throughput short-read alignments, or for any other comparative genomic analyses.

Each genome comes with a companion MOD file, which can be used to remap coordinates from the FASTA sequences back to reference coordinates. This is necessary since, in general, all gene and genomic annotations are specified relative to the reference. MOD files are genome and version specific, and therefore should always be downloaded together as a set with their associated FASTA sequence.

We supply two types of genomes, sequenced and imputed. Sequenced genomes result from direct DNA sequencing at a minimum of 30x coverage, and an iterative alignment process.

Genome size data have numerous applications: they can be used in comparative studies on genome evolution, or as a tool to appraise the cost of whole-genome sequencing programs. The growing interest in genome size and increasing rate of data accumulation has necessitated the continued update of these databases. Currently, the Plant DNA C-values database (Release 6.0, Dec. 2012) contains data for 8510 species, while GSAD has 1219 species (Release 2.0, June 2013), representing increases of 17 and 51%, respectively, in the number of species with genome size data, compared with previous releases.

This exon array contains approximately 1.4 million probesets consisting of approximately 5.4 million probes and profiles over 17,000 well-annotated gene transcripts in the human genome. As with all expression arrays, the exon array is vulnerable to SNPs within probes, because these SNPs can affect the hybridization of the probes and thus produce misleading expression values. In some cases, this could result in dramatic fluctuations of the exon-level expression. For this reason, we performed a genome-wide search for SNPs within regions that hybridize to probes by evaluating approximately 18 million SNPs in dbSNP (Build 129) and about 5.4 million probes in the exon array.

Since their first description about two decades ago, numerous studies have been undertaken dealing with the design, synthesis, characterization and application of foldamers. They have huge application potential as antimicrobial, anticancer and anti-HIV agents and in materials science. Despite their importance, there is no publicly available web resource providing comprehensive information on these compounds. Here we describe FoldamerDB, an open-source, fully annotated and manually curated database of peptidic foldamers. FoldamerDB holds the information about the sequence, structure and biological activities of the foldamer entries. It contains the information on over 1319 species and 1018 activities, collected from more than 160 research papers. The web-interface is designed to be clutter-free, user-friendly and it is compatible with devices of different screen sizes. The interface allows the user to search the database, browse and filter the foldamers using multiple criteria. It also offers a detailed help page to assist new users. FoldamerDB is hoped to bridge the gap in the freely available web-based resources on foldamers and will be of interest to diverse groups of scientists from chemists to biologists.

‘Manually Curated Database of Rice Proteins’ is a literature based manually curated protein centric database of rice proteins. The database provides experimental data embedded in published articles in a computer searchable format. The literature curation workflow is fundamentally different than most other literature mining approaches, which concentrate on mining the text of the articles to extract information. The in-house developed manual curation models enable digitization of the experimental data itself. Emphasis is given to experiments that provide direct information about a protein/gene expression or activity. Thus, data from experiments such as quantitative/semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Northern analysis, protein-protein or DNA-protein interaction, enzymatic assays, trait analysis etc. have been manually digitized using these in-house developed data curation models. As a result of such curation one is able to search, for example, all RT-PCR based gene expression data for a particular rice protein published in several different publications in a matter of seconds. The data curation models extensively utilize well-known ontologies such as Gene Ontology (GO), Plant Ontology (PO), Trait Ontology (TO), Environmental Ontology (EO) etc. to facilitate seamless integration of experimental data across publications. Since the existing ontologies were not sufficient to represent the immensely diverse data available in published literature a large number of new terms have also been appended to the existing ontologies. Moreover, several other coding systems were also developed to systematically capture aspects of the experimental data that was beyond the scope of the existing ontologies. Current release of the database has data for over 2390 rice proteins from over 550 research articles.",http://www.genomeindia.org/biocuration,2014.0,University of Delhi South Campus,"Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, New Delhi – 110021, India",,,India,,Saurabh Raghuvanshi,saurabh@genomeindia.org,1.0,,9.0,11.0,$2a$10$mt/w9LCIa8pVe71nYi.5luzyP6942Jsecq8kjrlVP/GEtgK0MBUvu,1544082533982.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1517088373000.0,2023-03-03 10:13:41,Protein,Literature,"RT-PCR, DNA-protein interaction, protein-protein interaction",Plant,Oryza sativa,,1.22222,2014.0,,2022-12-04 00:01:29,1.0,home,Manually Curated Database of Rice Proteins

However, despite the fact that the biological activity of many proteins often arises from specific domain-domain and domain-ligand interactions, current on-line resources rarely provide a direct mapping from structure to function at the domain level. Since the PDB now contains many tens of thousands of protein chains, and since protein sequence databases can dwarf such numbers by orders of magnitude, there is a pressing need to develop automatic structure-function annotation tools which can operate at the domain level. This article presents ECDomainMiner, a novel content-based filtering approach to automatically infer associations between EC numbers and Pfam domains. ECDomainMiner finds a total of 20,728 non-redundant EC-Pfam associations with a F- measure of 0.95 with respect to a ""Gold Standard"" test set extracted from InterPro. Compared to the 1,515 manually curated EC-Pfam associations in InterPro, ECDomainMiner infers a 13-fold increase in the number of EC-Pfam associations.

Knowledge of the specific functions of protein domains encoded by the genome of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major human pathogen that contributes to liver disease worldwide, remains limited to insight from small-scale studies. To enhance the capabilities of HCV researchers, we have obtained a high-resolution functional map of the entire viral genome by combining transposon-based insertional mutagenesis with next-generation sequencing. We generated a library of 8,398 mutagenized HCV clones, each containing one 15-nucleotide sequence inserted at a unique genomic position. We passaged this library in hepatic cells, recovered virus pools, and simultaneously assayed the abundance of mutant viruses in each pool by next-generation sequencing. To illustrate the validity of the functional profile, we compared the genetic footprints of viral proteins with previously solved protein structures. Moreover, we show the utility of these genetic footprints in the identification of candidate regions for epitope tag insertion. In a second application, we screened the genetic footprints for phenotypes that reflected defects in later steps of the viral life cycle. We confirmed that viruses with insertions in a region of the nonstructural protein NS4B had a defect in infectivity while maintaining genome replication.

miRnalyze predicts putative miRNA targets in cellular signaling pathways directly through identifying involved genes in those pathways. Additionally, it provides users with the ability to identify common miRNAs that have more than one target in the signal transduction pathways – a feature that is unique to miRnalyze. Further, the tool allows users to sort the enlisted miRNAs based on their type of seed matches and the TargetScan Context++ score. The results thereby displayed in a hierarchy of manner allowing user to identify most relevant miRNAs on top of the lists.

AgAbDb is a derived knowledgebase developed with an objective to compile, curate, and analyze determinants of interactions between the respective antigen-antibody molecules. AgAbDb lists not only the residues of binding sites of antigens and antibodies, but also interacting residue pairs. It also helps in the identification of interacting residues and buried residues that constitute antibody-binding sites of protein and peptide antigens. The Antigen-Antibody Interaction Finder (AAIF), a program developed in-house, is used to compile the molecular interactions, viz. van der Waals interactions, salt bridges, and hydrogen bonds. A module for curating water-mediated interactions has also been developed. In addition, various residue-level features, viz. accessible surface area, data on epitope segment, and secondary structural state of binding site residues, are also compiled. Apart from the PDB numbering, Wu-Kabat numbering and explicit definitions of complementarity-determining regions are provided for residues of antibodies. The molecular interactions can be visualized using the program Jmol. AgAbDb can be used as a benchmark dataset to validate algorithms for prediction of B-cell epitopes. It can as well be used to improve accuracy of existing algorithms and to design new algorithms. AgAbDb can also be used to design mimotopes representing antigens as well as aid in designing processes leading to humanization of antibodies.",http://bioinfo.net.in/AgAbDb,2014.0,Savitribai Phule Pune University,"Bioinformatics Centre, University of Pune, Ganeshkhind Road, Pune, 411007, Maharashtra, India",,,India,,Kulkarni-Kale U,urmila@bioinfo.net.in,0.0,,9.0,6.0,$2a$10$hqK8Q3gFgAHuHGPLdugFkeD1n8Hlu7zC8Wk9DnfrLMMT9V0JyrPMO,1544082525291.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1517084229000.0,2023-09-14 11:30:38,Protein,Health and medicine,"Antigen-Antibody Interaction, protein-protein interactions, immune",Animal,Homo sapiens,,0.666667,2014.0,,2022-12-04 00:01:26,0.0,home,AgAbDb

High-throughput screening of large chemical compound libraries has yielded new findings in plant biology, with possible future applications in agriculture and horticulture. To further understand ethylene biosynthesis/signaling and its crosstalk with other hormones, we screened a 12,000 compound chemical library based on an ethylene-related bioassay of dark-grown Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seedlings. From the initial screening, 1313 (∼11%) biologically active small molecules altering the phenotype triggered by the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), were identified. Selection and sorting in classes were based on the angle of curvature of the apical hook, the length and width of the hypocotyl and the root. A MySQL-database was constructed (https://chaos.ugent.be/WE15/) including basic chemical information on the compounds, images illustrating the phenotypes, phenotype descriptions and classification.

With higher protein content than other major cereals, wheat has great socio- economic importance. Nonetheless for wheat, three important fungal pathogens i.e. rust, smut and bunt are major cause of significant yield losses throughout the world. Researchers are putting up a strong fight against devastating wheat pathogens, and have made progress in tracking and controlling disease outbreaks from East Africa to South Asia. The aim of the present work hence was to develop a fungal pathogens database dedicated to wheat, gathering information about different pathogen species and linking them to their biological classification, distribution and control. Towards this end, we developed an open access database Tripath: A biological, genetic and genomic database of economically important wheat fungal pathogens - rust: smut: bunt. Data collected from peer-reviewed publications and fungal pathogens were added to the customizable database through an extended relational design. The strength of this resource is in providing rapid retrieval of information from large volumes of text at a high degree of accuracy.

Its symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, bloating gas, diarrhea and constipation. Many IBS patients also have psychological symptoms like depression or anxiety. These unpleasant symptoms significantly lower patients׳ quality of life. The prevalence of IBS in Europe and North America is about 10-15% of the population, which makes IBS a disorder with a high social cost. The pathophysiology of IBS is considered to be multifactorial and the exact cause of the disease remains poorly understood. Recently, a genome-wide expression microarray technique has been applied to investigate the possible mechanisms of IBS. However, a user-friendly database that allows scientists without bioinformatics background to query gene expression levels in these data sets and compare gene expression patterns across different tissues has not yet been established. Therefore, we have integrated four public expression microarray data (320 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases into an online database called Transcriptome of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (TIBS). The gene expression change in IBS patients compared to healthy volunteers or UC patients in jejunum, sigmoid colon, rectum, and descending colon can be queried by gene symbols. Users can compare gene expression levels of IBS patients across these tissues. Sex difference of gene expression in IBS patients was also shown in the database. The current version of TIBS database contains 42,400 annotated gene probe sets represented on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 platform.

However, a comprehensive genomic annotation of endogenous G4s (eG4s) and systematic characterization of their regulatory network are still lacking, raising great challenges for eG4 research. Here, we present EndoQuad to address these pressing issues by integrating high-throughput experimental data. First, based on more than 1200 high-quality genome-wide eG4s mapping datasets generated by G4 ChIP-seq/CUT&Tag, we generate a reference set of genome-wide eG4s across human, mouse, and chicken. Our multi-omics analyses show that most eG4s are identified in one or a few cell types. The eG4s with higher occurrences across samples are more structurally stable, evolutionarily conserved, enriched in promoter regions, mark highly expressed genes, and associate with complex regulatory programs, demonstrating higher confidence level for further functional study. Finally, we integrate millions of functional genomic variants and prioritize eG4s with regulatory functions in disease and cancer context. These efforts have culminated in the comprehensive and interactive database of experimentally validated DNA eG4s. As such, EndoQuad enables users to easily access, download, and repurpose these data for their own research. EndoQuad will become a one-stop resource for eG4 research and lays the foundation for future functional study.",https://endoquad.chenzxlab.cn/,2022.0,Huazhong Agricultural University,"‎Huazhong Agricultural University, No. 1 Shizishan Street, Hongshan District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province",Wuhan,Hubei,China,1.0,Zhen-Xia Chen,zhen-xia.chen@mail.hzau.edu.cn,1.0,2023,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,2021ABA011; 2021hszd012; 2022hszd024; 2022hszd028; SZYJY2021010,zhen-xia.chen@mail.hzau.edu.cn,0.0,,1698802848000.0,2023-11-01 17:47:36,DNA,"Structure, Metadata","Endogenous G-quadruplex, G4 ChIP-seq, Gene regulation",Animal,"Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus",,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,home,EndoQuad

Because protein-coding regions are typically under high selective constraints, these variants occur at low frequencies, such that there is often insufficient statistics for downstream calculations. We make use of the modular structure of repeat motifs to amplify signals of selection from population genetics and traditional inter-species conservation. For each repeat protein repeat domain, we construct a motif-MSA and then accumulate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the human population based on the genomic coordinate system of the motif-MSA.

Among the agents of infection and disease in domestic poultry and wild birds, Mycoplasma gallisepticum is the most important mycoplasma species, causing considerable losses in the poultry industry. In the present paper, we provide data on adaptation of M. gallisepticum to the eukaryotic host cells on the genomic level. The major changes were predominantly localized in the VlhA-hemagglutinin genes which are important components of pathogenesis. The ability of mycoplasmas to change dramatically the repertoire of surface antigens and to vary the immunogenicity of these components allows them to remain undetected by the immune system of the host. The data presented in this article are related to the article entitled ""Phase Transition of the Bacterium upon Invasion of a Host Cell as a Mechanism of Adaptation: a Mycoplasma gallisepticum Model.""

Enzybiotics are becoming increasingly recognized as potential alternative therapies for drug-resistant bacteria. Enzybiotics are referred to as bacterial cell wall-degrading enzymes, including lysins, bacteriocins, autolysins, and lysozymes. Fischetti and coworkers coined the term ""enzybiotics"" for these proteins, describing both enzymatic and antibacterial properties. The most important characteristics of enzybiotics are their novel mechanisms of antibacterial action and capacity to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Another significant feature of certain enzybiotics is their low probability of developing bacterial resistance.

Enzybiotics have been optimized through evolution to cause fast and efficient lysis of the host cell from within, thereby ensuring the phage's survival. However, this does not preclude that there is still potential for important when it comes to application from without, especially in complex environments such as certain food matrics, blood or on mucous membranes.

The lack of innovations in antibiotic development has led to renewed interest in antibiotic adjuvants. However, there is no database to collect antibiotic adjuvants. Herein, we build a comprehensive database named Antibiotic Adjuvant DataBase (AADB) by manually collecting relevant literature. Specifically, AADB includes 3,035 combinations of antibiotics with adjuvants, covering 83 antibiotics, 226 adjuvants, and 325 bacterial strains. AADB provides user-friendly interfaces for searching and downloading. Users can easily obtain these datasets for further analysis. In addition, we also collected related datasets (e.g., chemogenomic and metabolomic data) and proposed a computational strategy to dissect these datasets. As a test case, we identified 10 candidates for minocycline, and 6 of 10 candidates are the known adjuvants that synergize with minocycline to inhibit the growth of E. coli BW25113. We hope that AADB can help users to identify effective antibiotic adjuvants.

Here, we introduce the largest integration and proteogenomic analysis of novel peptides to assess the prevalence of non-canonical ORFs (ncORFs) in more than 900 patient proteomes and 26 immunopeptidome datasets across 14 cancer types. The integrative proteogenomic analysis of whole-cell proteomes and immunopeptidomes revealed peptide support for a nonredundant set of 9760 upstream, downstream, and out-of-frame ncORFs in protein coding genes and 12811 in noncoding RNAs. Notably, 6486 ncORFs were derived from differentially expressed genes and 340 were ubiquitously translated across eight or more cancers.

Afterwards, the information is merged into the Hetionet structure. Different mapping methods are used such as external identification systems or name mapping. The resulting open-source Neo4j database PharMeBINet has 2,869,407 different nodes with 66 labels and 15,883,653 relationships with 208 edge types. It is a heterogeneous database containing interconnected information on ADRs, diseases, drugs, genes, gene variations, proteins, and more.

However, most of these methods identify circRNA-RBP binding sites are only based on single data resource and cannot provide exact binding sites, only providing the probability value of a sequence fragment. To solve these problems, we propose a binding sites localization algorithm that fuses binding sites from multiple databases, and further design a stacked generalization ensemble deep learning model named CirRBP to identify RBP binding sites on circRNA. The CirRBP is trained by combining the binding sites from multiple databases and makes predictions by weighted aggregating the predictions of each sub-model. The results show that the CirRBP outperforms any sub-model and existing online prediction model.

Establishing structure-activity relationships as a premise to their development is hindered because full structural characterization including stereochemical information requires labor-intensive analyses, without guarantee for success. Moreover, increasing use of superficial comparison with previously characterized CLiPs introduces or propagates erroneous attributions, clouding further scientific progress. We provide a generally applicable characterization methodology based on matching NMR spectral fingerprints of newly isolated CLiPs to natural and synthetic reference compounds with (un)known stereochemistry. In addition, NMR fingerprinting is shown to provide a suitable basis for structural dereplication. A publicly available reference compound repository promises to facilitate participation of the lipopeptide research community in structural assessment and dereplication of newly isolated CLiPs, which should also support further developments in genome mining for novel CLiPs.",https://www.rhizoclip.be,2022.0,Ghent University,"NMR and Structure Analysis Unit, Ghent Universitygrid.5342.0, Department of Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry, Ghent, Belgium.",,,Belgium,1.0,José C Martins,jose.martins@ugent.be,1.0,2022-08-31,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1692802335000.0,2023-09-13 13:22:15,"DNA, RNA",Literature,Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR),,,,,0.0,,,0.0,home,Rhizoclip

To systematically prioritize the oncogenic ability of somatic mutations and cancer genes, we constructed a useful platform, OncoVar (https://oncovar.org/), which employed published bioinformatics algorithms and incorporated known driver events to identify driver mutations and driver genes. We identified 20 162 cancer driver mutations, 814 driver genes and 2360 pathogenic pathways with high-confidence by reanalyzing 10 769 exomes from 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1942 genomes from 18 cancer types in International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). OncoVar provides four points of view, ‘Mutation’, ‘Gene’, ‘Pathway’ and ‘Cancer’, to help researchers to visualize the relationships between cancers and driver variants. Importantly, identification of actionable driver alterations provides promising druggable targets and repurposing opportunities of combinational therapies. OncoVar provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading somatic driver mutations, driver genes and pathogenic pathways in various cancer types. This platform will facilitate the identification of cancer drivers across individual cancer cohorts and helps to rank mutations or genes for better decision-making among clinical oncologists, cancer researchers and the broad scientific community interested in cancer precision medicine.",https://oncovar.org/,2021.0,Peking University Third Hospital,,Beijing,Beijing,China,V1,Fengbiao Mao,maofengbiao@126.com,1.0,2020,2.0,28.0,,,0.0,maofengbiao@126.com,0.0,,maofengbiao@126.com,0.0,,1612492784000.0,2023-03-03 10:17:27,DNA,"Genotype phenotype and variation, Health and medicine","driver genes, oncogenic pathways, driver mutation",Animal,human,,14.0,0.0,,2022-12-04 00:02:48,0.0,home,OncoVar

There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC), and host protein-DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data. First, 1,047 unique DMEs (448 host and 599 microbial) were confirmed, for the first time, using their metabolizing drugs. Second, for these newly confirmed DMEs, all types of their interactions (3,359 MICBIOs between 225 microbial species and 185 DMEs; 47,778 XEOTICs between 4,150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs; 7,849 HOSPPIs between 565 human proteins and 566 DMEs) were comprehensively collected and then provided, which enabled the crosstalk analysis among multiple types. Because of the huge amount of accumulated data, the INTEDE made it possible to generalize key features for revealing disease etiology and optimizing clinical treatment.

The dataset includes both benign and malignant images. The task associated with this dataset is the automated classification of these images in two classes, which would be a valuable computer-aided diagnosis tool for the clinician. In order to assess the difficulty of this task, we show some preliminary results obtained with state-of-the-art image classification systems. The accuracy ranges from 80% to 85%, showing room for improvement is left.
